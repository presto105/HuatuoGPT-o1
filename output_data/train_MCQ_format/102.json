Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: CR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given multiple-choice question is \"Ambiguous Answer.\" \n\nThe reason for this evaluation is that the correct answer provided, \"Complete Response (CR),\" is not supported by the clinical profile given. A complete response would imply no evidence of disease, which is unlikely given the patient's advanced cancer, presence of brain metastasis, and specific genetic and PD-L1 profile. The provided clinical details do not clearly justify a CR, making the correct answer choice ambiguous. Therefore, the question does not meet the criterion of having an unambiguous correct answer."
