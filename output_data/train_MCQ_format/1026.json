Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 67 years old,Sex: F,Height: 160 cm,Body weight: 67 kg,BMI: 26.33,Smoking history: Current smoker,Cancer stage: SqCC,Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,PD-L1 group: 1~49%,PD-L1 (22C3): 40%,PD-L1 (SP263): 30%,WBC: 5.35,Albumin: 3.5 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 0.96,Neutrophil: 3.82,LDH level: 318.0 U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Gemcitabine/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: RB1,TP53,CNV alterations: ALK(gain),PIK3CA(gain),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 20.5 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
