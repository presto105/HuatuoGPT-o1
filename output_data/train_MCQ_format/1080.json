Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 51 years old,Sex: F,Height: 161 cm,Body weight: 38 kg,BMI: 14.71,Smoking history: Current smoker,Cancer stage: SqCC,Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,PD-L1 group: 0%,PD-L1 (22C3): 0%,WBC: 11.49,Albumin: 3.1 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 2.42,Neutrophil: 7.89,LDH level: 232.0 U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy + Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pembrolizumab/Paclitaxel/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: KDM6A,CNV alterations: FGFR3(gain),FGFR4(loss),MYC(gain),Fusion genes: FGFR3,Splice variants: None,TMB: 6.4 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
