Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The question is evaluated as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires the analysis of various clinical parameters and genetic alterations to determine the treatment response, which involves a deeper understanding of oncology and the implications of each parameter on treatment efficacy. Therefore, it does not appear \"Too Simple.\"\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** While the question provides a set of complex information, the explanation or rationale for why the correct answer is \"Stable Disease\" (SD) rather than the other options is not provided. This makes it difficult to unequivocally conclude that \"Stable Disease\" is the superior choice without more information regarding the rubric or criteria used for determining the response. As it stands, the correct answer is somewhat arbitrary without further justification, rendering the question susceptible to potential ambiguity if not grounded in a clear clinical decision framework. However, the way the options are presented implies they are mutually exclusive, which adheres to having a single correct answer based on existing knowledge of the case.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could potentially be reformulated into an open-ended problem by asking, \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and genetic information, what is the most likely treatment response, and why?\" This reformulation would expect a detailed explanation as support for the response, with a clear ground-truth answer being established.\n\nTaking these evaluations into account: Given the clinical complexity and need for in-depth analysis using multiple types of data (clinical, laboratory, genetic), the question does require deeper reasoning and could likely be discussed in open-ended terms. However, the absence of a rationale supporting \"Stable Disease\" as the definitive correct answer slightly compromises the unambiguity necessary. In the context of the evaluation criteria, we'll pass it tentatively, assuming the justification for \"Stable Disease\" aligns with clinical guidelines not explicitly mentioned here.\n\nFinal evaluation: **Pass**",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
