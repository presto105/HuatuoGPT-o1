Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Evaluation: Not Reformulatable**\n\nThe given multiple-choice question, which involves a complex cancer patient profile and asks for the most likely treatment response, does indeed require deep reasoning. The question prompts the evaluator to consider the patient's clinical and molecular profile to determine the treatment outcome. \n\nHowever, the nature of the question's answer choices (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease) correlates closely with defined medical categorizations based on clinical evaluation and observation rather than on an easily quantifiable metric. Moreover, the rationale for selecting \"Progressive Disease\" as the correct answer depends on specific clinical knowledge, such as the presence of brain metastases and specific genetic mutations, which leads the clinical team to anticipate likely unsuccessful treatment with Gefitinib due to factors like resistant mutations or inadequate penetration.\n\nConsidering the complexity in physician decision-making based on clinical experience, precise current data, and potential interpretation variability inherent in anticipating treatment response, reformulating it into an open-ended format becomes problematic.\n\nOverall, while the question demonstrates depth and may not be unambiguous to clinical professionals in this field due to the clinical context they operate in, formulating this into a precise open-ended question with a ground truth becomes highly challenging. Hence, it is marked as \"Not Reformulatable.\""
