Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Not Reformulatable**\n\nThe question presents a specific clinical profile and asks to predict the most likely treatment response from a set list of options. While the question demands some depth of reasoning to evaluate the likelihood of treatment outcomes based on multiple clinical factors (such as PD-L1 expression, genetic mutations, and treatment type), and offers an unambiguous correct answer, its format is not easily reformulatable into an open-ended problem with a clear ground-truth answer. The open-ended format would struggle to provide a unique and objective assessment of treatment response without predefined categories or measurable data points as given in the multiple-choice format."
