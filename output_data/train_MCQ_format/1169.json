Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The given question evaluates the response of a patient's cancer treatment based on a detailed clinical profile using multiple data points such as PD-L1 expression, EGFR status, ALK status, and more. Let's analyze it against the criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** This question indeed requires deep reasoning. The response prediction involves integrating a variety of clinical data, including PD-L1 levels, genetic mutations, and other aspects of the patient's health and cancer profile. The reasoning required to predict treatment response is complex and relies on understanding how these factors interact in an oncological context, particularly in the realm of immunotherapy with pembrolizumab.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question specifies \"Correct Answer: PD\" as the expected treatment response, which is Progressive Disease. Given the details, particularly lower TMB and the wild-type EGFR combined with specific genetic alterations, the determination of PD can be considered consistent with advanced reasoning in the context of immunotherapy responses. Therefore, the correct answer isn't ambiguous.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** This question could be reformulated into an open-ended problem where reasoning must be provided for predicting the most likely treatment response. For instance: \"Given the patient's clinical profile, discuss the factors influencing the likelihood of pembrolizumab treatment response and predict the outcome.\" The detailed clinical data allows for a clear answer and justification.\n\nThe question meets all criteria for depth, clarity of the expected answer, and reformulability into an open-ended format.\n\nEvaluation: \"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
