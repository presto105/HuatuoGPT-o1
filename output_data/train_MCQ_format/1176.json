Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation of the given multiple-choice question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires evaluating multiple clinical factors to predict the most likely treatment response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, which involves understanding the significance of biomarkers like PD-L1, TMB, and specific genetic alterations. This necessitates a deep level of understanding and integration of the patient's clinical profile, making it not \"Too Simple.\"\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a unique correct answer (SD - Stable Disease) based on the clinical data presented. Each potential response correlates with a different understanding of the clinical situation, and the data presented supports Stable Disease as the most plausible outcome, indicating the answer is not \"Ambiguous.\"\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking, \"Based on the clinical profile provided, predict the most likely treatment response.\" This allows for a clear ground-truth answer, maintaining the depth and reasoning required. Thus, the question is \"Reformulatable.\"\n\nGiven these considerations, the evaluation for the question is:\n\n\"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
