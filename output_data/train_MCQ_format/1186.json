Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 59 years old,Sex: M,Height: 179 cm,Body weight: 64 kg,BMI: 19.97,Smoking history: Current smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: >50%,PD-L1 (22C3): 95%,PD-L1 (SP263): 90%,WBC: 9.04,Albumin: 4.4 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 1.35,Neutrophil: 6.88,LDH level: 212.0 U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pemetrexed,SNV mutations: ATM,NRAS,TP53,CNV alterations: BRAF(gain),CCNE1(gain),CDK6(gain),CDKN2A(loss),CDKN2B(loss),EGFR(gain),EZH2(gain),MDM4(gain),MET(gain),NRAS(gain),RHEB(gain),TFRC(loss),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 8.6 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
