Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for this question is \"Ambiguous Answer.\" \n\nRationale:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question appears to require interpretation of clinical data and understanding of treatment response criteria, which involves somewhat deeper reasoning. However, it depends heavily on specific medical knowledge regarding the treatment's efficacy.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a pre-selected \"Correct Answer: PD\" (Progressive Disease). However, based on the given details—especially the patient responding to Osimertinib (a known treatment for EGFR mutations) with high PD-L1 expression (which can imply responsiveness to certain therapies)—it may not be entirely clear why Progressive Disease is chosen over another response like Partial Response. Therefore, without comprehensive justification for each option, this could lead to ambiguity.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The scenario could theoretically be reformulated into an open-ended question, asking what the expected treatment response would be based on the patient's profile. However, its evaluative potential depends on consistent interpretation of clinical guidelines and expected treatment outcomes, leaning again into ambiguity if different experts might reach different conclusions.\n\nGiven the potential for differing interpretations of clinical data without additional context, the question fits the \"Ambiguous Answer\" criteria."
