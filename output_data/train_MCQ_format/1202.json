Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "Based on the criteria provided, I will assess the given multiple-choice question:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question presents a complex patient clinical profile, including details like age, cancer histology, EGFR status, PD-L1 levels, and genetic mutations. Determining the treatment response requires integrating multiple factors such as the PD-L1 expression, the presence of mutations, and the chosen treatment regimen. This necessitates a deeper understanding of how these factors interact in cancer immunotherapy, suggesting that the question requires significant clinical reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The correct answer is indicated as \"SD\" (Stable Disease), which seems to be selected based on the given clinical information and treatment regimen. However, without additional context or clear domain-specific guidelines on how these factors contribute exclusively to \"Stable Disease,\" the determination might not be entirely straightforward. Clinical decision-making often has a degree of variability, especially given the dynamic nature of cancer progression and treatment response. Still, the question does provide a specified correct answer.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could potentially be restructured to ask, \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and treatment regimen, what is the predicted treatment response?\" This invites an open-ended response while allowing for a more elaborate justification based on clinical reasoning pathways, using the information provided. \n\nGiven the potential for variability in treatment outcomes and the lack of context provided to justify why \"Stable Disease\" is the unequivocal correct answer, there is a degree of ambiguity in the answer selection. Additionally, while an open-ended reformulation is possible, ensuring that it would lead to a singular unambiguous ground-truth answer remains challenging without more specific clinical guidelines.\n\nEvaluation: **Ambiguous Answer**"
