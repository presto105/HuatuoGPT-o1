Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for this question is \"Pass.\" \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires understanding and interpreting multiple clinical parameters to assess the likely treatment response. It involves analyzing factors like cancer stage, histology, PD-L1 levels, genetic mutations, and treatment regimen, suggesting a level of complexity and depth in reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a single, clearly stated correct answer (SD for Stable Disease), which indicates it is not ambiguous and does not allow for multiple correct answers.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question by asking what the most likely treatment response is based on the given clinical profile, maintaining the complexity and depth of the original.\n\nOverall, the question meets all the criteria.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
