Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the given question, let's examine it against the provided criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves understanding a complex clinical profile of a cancer patient, including treatment and genetic factors, to determine the likely treatment response. This requires integrating various pieces of information, such as cancer type, genetic mutations, and treatment regimen, to predict the treatment outcome. Therefore, it requires deeper reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question appears to provide an unambiguous correct answer by considering the clinical details and the provided treatment response options. It specifies \"Correct Answer: SD,\" which suggests that only one of the choices is considered correct in this context.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking, \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and treatment regimen, what is the most likely response to the treatment?\" This would still allow for a clear ground-truth answer (in this case, \"Stable Disease\"), supporting reformulation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the evaluation would be:\n\n\"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
