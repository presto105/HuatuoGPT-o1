Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: CR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "- \"Ambiguous Answer\" \n\nThe provided multiple-choice question is not suitable for evaluation as it does not have a clear and unambiguous correct answer. The correct answer given, \"CR\" (Complete Response), is not internally consistent with the provided patient profile and treatment details. The patient's status, particularly the EGFR wild type and the absence of a common actionable mutation that would lead to a complete response with Erlotinib, suggests that a complete response is unlikely. Moreover, the question requires high-level integration of clinical data, genomic alterations, and therapeutic implications, often requiring specialist domain knowledge to make predictions. As such, the multiple-choice question could lead to ambiguous interpretations, and the current correct answer is likely incorrect, given the profile."
