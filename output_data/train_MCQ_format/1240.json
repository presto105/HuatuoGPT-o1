Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: CR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation of the given multiple-choice question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves assessing a complex patient profile with multiple clinical and genetic parameters to predict treatment response. This requires a deeper understanding of oncology, biomarker significance, and treatment response criteria, which goes beyond surface-level analysis. The question asks the evaluator to consider factors such as PD-L1 status, TMB, presence of mutations, and a specific treatment regimen, all of which influence immunotherapy outcomes.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The correct answer provided is \"Complete Response (CR),\" which suggests that the responders believe the patient's specific profile would lead to a complete response to the treatment. Given the level of detail in the clinical profile, it supports pinpointing a specific treatment response, making the answer unambiguous. However, it's important to consider whether expert consensus would agree with the CR since predicting such a response often involves probabilities and can seem speculative with limited patient-specific data.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format, where it asks for an evaluation of the likely treatment outcome based on the patientâ€™s detailed clinical profile. It thus allows for a clear and reasoned explanation leading to a \"Complete Response\" as the expected answer.\n\nBased on the above considerations, the appropriate evaluation is \"Pass,\" assuming the medical rationale provided aligns with established prediction criteria for similar clinical profiles.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
