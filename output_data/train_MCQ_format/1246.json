Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given question is: \"Pass\".\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires deeper reasoning because it involves understanding complex patient data and treatment response predictions within the context of cancer biology and pharmacotherapy, particularly targeted therapy using Afatinib. This demands an understanding of the interaction between the patient's cancer profile, genetic alterations, and how they influence treatment response.\n   \n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question has a unique and unambiguous correct answer, which is \"Partial Response,\" as indicated in the description. It does not rely on subjective judgment or partial credit options.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reasonably reformulated into an open-ended problem by asking, \"Based on the provided clinical profile and treatment details, what is the most likely treatment response for this patient?\" This formulation allows for a clear ground-truth answer, making it suitable for open-ended format conversion.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 81 years old,Sex: M,Height: 167.9 cm,Body weight: 67.1 kg,BMI: 23.80,Smoking history: Former smoker,Cancer stage: SqCC,Histology: squamous cell carcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,EGFR status: E19del,PD-L1 group: 1~49%,PD-L1 (SP263): 1%,WBC: 9.61,Albumin: 3.7 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 0.97,Neutrophil: 7.35,LDH level: 145.0 U/L,Treatment type: Targeted Therapy,Treatment regimen: Afatinib,SNV mutations: CHEK2,EGFR,PIK3CA,STK11,TP53,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 0.0 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
