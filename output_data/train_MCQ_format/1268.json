Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given question is as follows:\n\n- **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves understanding various factors such as cancer type, metastasis presence, PD-L1 status, and specific mutation information to evaluate the response to a combination treatment of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This requires integrating multiple pieces of clinical information to reason about the likely treatment response, which indicates deeper reasoning.\n  \n- **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a specific answer as \"SD\" (Stable Disease) and does not appear to allow for multiple interpretations or answers. The clinical data provided align with a stable disease understanding in the context of the response criteria.\n  \n- **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question such as: \"Based on the patient clinical profile provided, what is the most likely treatment response to the Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin regimen?\" This allows for a clear-ground truth answer reflecting the given data.\n\nGiven these evaluations, the question meets all criteria.\n\n**Pass**",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 70 years old,Sex: M,Height: 172.8 cm,Body weight: 65.8 kg,BMI: 22.04,Smoking history: Former smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 0%,PD-L1 (22C3): <1%,PD-L1 (SP263): <1%,WBC: 7.22,Albumin: 3.9 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 0.99,Neutrophil: 6.11,LDH level: 245.0 U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy + Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: CTNNB1,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
