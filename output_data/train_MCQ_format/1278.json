Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "Based on the criteria provided, the evaluation for the given question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires a deep understanding of medical oncology, specifically the interpretation of various clinical and molecular factors to determine the likely treatment response to pembrolizumab. These factors include PD-L1 expression, TMB, genetic alterations, and existing metastases. This complexity ensures that the question is not too simple.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a definitive correct answer (Progressive Disease), based on the patient's profile and the known effects of pembrolizumab in such contexts. There is no ambiguity in determining the most likely treatment response given the data presented.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format. For example: \"Given the clinical and molecular profile of a 71-year-old male patient with advanced adenocarcinoma and specific molecular characteristics, predict the most likely response to pembrolizumab treatment and justify your reasoning.\" This allows for a clear ground-truth answer based on the reasoning process.\n\nTherefore, the correct evaluation for this question is:\n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
