Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The question's evaluation is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** \n   - The question involves interpreting clinical data to determine the most likely treatment response for a patient with a specific lung cancer profile undergoing targeted therapy with Gefitinib. This requires knowledge of cancer treatment responses, especially regarding EGFR mutations and drug response. Therefore, it involves deeper reasoning.\n   \n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** \n   - The question provides a clinical scenario and asks for the most likely treatment response. An expert in oncology may be able to determine the expected response based on the given details. However, the selection of \"SD\" (Stable Disease) as a definitive correct answer could be contentious without more detailed clinical context or response criteria. This introduces potential ambiguity in what is typically considered a nuanced medical assessment. Thus, it may be marked as \"Ambiguous Answer.\"\n   \n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:**\n   - The question can be reformulated open-endedly by asking, \"Based on the clinical profile, what is the most likely treatment response for this patient treated with Gefitinib?\" However, providing a clear, ground-truth answer can still be a challenge, similar to the issue above due to potential variability in clinical outcomes.\n\nGiven these considerations, the evaluation for the question is:\n\n\"Ambiguous Answer\""
