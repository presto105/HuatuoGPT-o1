Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation of the question is \"Pass\". \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires understanding specific clinical and genetic profiles, targeted therapy specifics, and their implications on treatment response. This entails complex reasoning beyond basic knowledge.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question specifies one treatment response (Stable Disease - SD) as the correct answer based on the clinical details provided, making it unambiguous.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question, such as \"Based on the given clinical profile, what is the most likely treatment response to targeted therapy with Afatinib?\" with \"Stable Disease\" as the ground-truth answer.",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
