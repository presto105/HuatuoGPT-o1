Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Evaluation: Not Reformulatable**\n\nThe question primarily requires evaluating the patient's clinical profile and treatment regimen to predict a likely treatment response. While it does involve considering various factors such as EGFR status, PD-L1 expression, and the chosen therapy, it ultimately results in selecting the most likely treatment response from the given options. This kind of question is typically tied to multiple-choice format evaluations, where specific clinical knowledge (often rooted in statistical outcomes and empirical data) leads to a conclusion based on expected treatment efficacy.\n\nIn open-ended reformulation feasibility, it's challenging to pose this question without the context of choices or anticipated responses, as treatment prediction often relies on subjective clinical interpretation alongside objective data. Therefore, it's not easily reformulated into an open-ended question with a singular, definitive ground-truth answer. The answer depends significantly on clinical guidelines, data trends, and individual patient response variability, which a multiple-choice format captures effectively but an open-ended format might not."
