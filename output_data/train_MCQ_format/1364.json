Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Pass**  \n\nThis question requires complex reasoning because it involves analyzing a detailed clinical profile and making a judgment based on various parameters like cancer characteristics, genetic alterations, and treatment regimen. The correct answer, \"Partial Response (PR),\" is unambiguous given the details provided. Furthermore, the scenario can be reformulated into an open-ended question, such as \"Based on the clinical profile provided, what is the most likely outcome of the treatment regimen of Pemetrexed/Cisplatin for this patient?\" This would allow for an answer with reasoning based on clinical and treatment factors.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 67 years old,Sex: M,Height: 160 cm,Body weight: 73 kg,BMI: 28.52,Smoking history: Former smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 0%,PD-L1 (22C3): 0%,WBC: 6.18,Albumin: 4.5 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 1.55,Neutrophil: 4.12,LDH level: Unknown U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pemetrexed/Cisplatin,SNV mutations: None,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
