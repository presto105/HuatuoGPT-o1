Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning**: The question requires an understanding of the complex medical and genetic factors affecting cancer treatment response. Assessing treatment response based on detailed clinical and genetic data requires deeper reasoning, as it involves synthesis of information about cancer characteristics, treatment regimen, and genetic mutations.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer**: The question specifies \"Correct Answer: PD\" (Progressive Disease), which indicates that the expectation is for the respondent to assess the most likely treatment response based on the given patient profile. The clarity of the correct answer being specified directly in the stem avoids ambiguity.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility**: The question is amenable to open-ended reformulation. For example, it could be reformulated as \"Based on the patient's clinical and genetic profile, predict the most likely treatment response to the specified therapy and justify your answer.\" This would still lead to a specific, fact-based answer.\n\nThe question meets all evaluation criteria, so the evaluation is: \n\n\"Pass\"",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 68 years old,Sex: M,Height: 164.2 cm,Body weight: 60.9 kg,BMI: 22.59,Smoking history: Current smoker,Cancer stage: Mixed,Histology: adenosquamous carcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 0%,PD-L1 (SP263): 0%,WBC: 8.0,Albumin: 4.9 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 2.01,Neutrophil: 5.2,LDH level: 175.0 U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy + Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: KEAP1,RPS6KA4,TP53,CNV alterations: EGFR(gain),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 8.7 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
