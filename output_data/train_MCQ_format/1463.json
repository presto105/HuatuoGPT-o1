Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "- **Evaluation**: Pass\n\n**Reasoning**:\n1. **Depth of Reasoning**: The question involves understanding and interpreting detailed clinical data, including genetic mutations, PD-L1 expression levels, and treatment regimen to determine the most likely outcome of the cancer treatment. This requires a deeper understanding of oncology, the significance of PD-L1 expression, and the mechanisms of the specific chemotherapy drugs mentioned.\n   \n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer**: The question provides a specific scenario with data points that lead to a unique treatment response in this context, which is noted as \"Partial Response (PR)\". This indicates that the provided information and clinical indicators point to a clear and correct answer.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility**: The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking, for example, \"Based on the provided clinical profile and treatment regimen, determine the most likely treatment response in this patient.\" This maintains the depth and requires a reasoned conclusion while allowing for a precise answer.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 58 years old,Sex: M,Height: 161 cm,Body weight: 67 kg,BMI: 25.85,Smoking history: Former smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: >50%,PD-L1 (22C3): 90%,PD-L1 (SP263): 100%,Albumin: Unknown g/dL,LDH level: Unknown U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pemetrexed/Cisplatin,SNV mutations: ARID1A,BRAF,NCOR1,NF1,TP53,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 11.9 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
