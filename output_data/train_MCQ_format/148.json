Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "\"Pass\" (The question requires deeper reasoning based on multiple clinical factors to determine the likely treatment response, has a unique and unambiguous correct answer, and could potentially be reformulated into an open-ended format focusing on the reasoning process leading to the treatment response outcome.)",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 85 years old,Sex: F,Height: 153 cm,Body weight: 55 kg,BMI: 23.53,Smoking history: Former smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: Adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,PD-L1 group: >50%,PD-L1 (22C3): 30%,PD-L1 (SP263): >50%,WBC: 16.16,Albumin: 3.3 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 2.54,Neutrophil: 11.99,LDH level: 209.0 U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy,Treatment regimen: Atezolizumab/Tiragolumab,SNV mutations: MET,TP53,CNV alterations: HIST1H3A(loss),MET(gain),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: MET,TMB: 7.1 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
