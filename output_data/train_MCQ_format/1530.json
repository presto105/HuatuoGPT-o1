Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The provided multiple-choice question requires interpretation of a detailed clinical profile to predict treatment response in a cancer patient. Here's the evaluation based on the given criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves understanding the implications of complex clinical data, including genetic mutations, biomarker status, and treatment options. This requires a deep understanding of oncology and pharmacogenomics, making the reasoning sufficiently complex.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question specifies that the correct answer is \"Stable Disease\" (SD), which suggests that despite certain mutations and PD-L1 status, the most likely outcome is SD. The data presented leads to a specific clinical judgment, so the answer is likely unambiguous for those well-versed in the subject.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into open-ended format, asking for a prediction of treatment response given a detailed patient profile. An expert could provide a justification or rationale for why a certain response is anticipated, allowing for a clear ground-truth answer.\n\nBased on the evaluation criteria, the question meets all the conditions for a \"Pass.\" It is neither too simple, ambiguous, nor unreformulatable into an open-ended question. Thus, the evaluation is:\n\n\"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
