Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Pass**  \n\nThe question meets all the criteria as follows:  \n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The evaluation of treatment response in this patient's clinical profile requires an understanding of oncology, specifically within the context of immunotherapy and its effectiveness in patients with specific molecular and histological characteristics. This involves evaluating PD-L1 expression, mutation profile, and other clinical factors, which requires deeper reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question has a clearly defined correct answer, which is \"Progressive Disease\" based on the given patient data and treatment response expectations. No indication suggests ambiguity or multiple correct responses.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format such as \"Based on the given patient clinical profile and treatment regimen, predict the most likely treatment response and provide justification.\" This allows for a detailed explanation and clear ground-truth answer.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
