Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: CR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Evaluation: Ambiguous Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the most likely treatment response from immunotherapy and chemotherapy in a patient with specific clinical and genetic attributes. While it may seem to have a definitive correct answer based on the clinical scenario provided, determining treatment response in oncology, especially with the given details, is often complex and can vary significantly.\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires understanding various clinical parameters, histological details, PD-L1 expression, and genomic information, suggesting it necessitates deeper reasoning.\n   \n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** Despite a designated \"Correct Answer\" (A. Complete Response), treatment responses are often probabilistic rather than deterministic. With the given data, it's difficult to assert with certainty that a \"Complete Response\" is the most likely outcome, as responses can vary, and the PD-L1 expression is relatively low (1%). Clinical reality rarely allows for absolute certainties. Therefore, there may be room for interpreting various responses as possible without further context provided in clinical guidelines specific to the question's scenario.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can potentially be reformulated into an open-ended format if asked something like \"What factors in this profile could influence treatment outcomes, and why?\" However, in its current form focused on selecting the \"most likely\" outcome, it doesn't cleanly transition to this format, mainly due to the probabilistic nature of cancer treatment outcomes.\n\nTherefore, while the question demonstrates depth and could potentially be reformulated, the ambiguity of the specified single correct answer prevents it from passing as it doesn't meet the unambiguity requirement.",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2.
