Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Evaluation: Not Reformulatable**\n\nThis question contains specific clinical details leading to a narrow set of choices regarding a patient's response to treatment. The response is based on specific medical data (e.g., genetic mutations, treatment type, etc.) that limit the openness of possible interpretations or broad insights that are generally expected in open-ended formats. While it includes complex medical information that requires some interpretive analysis, it doesn’t readily offer a clear path to reformulation into an open-ended question as it hinges on specialized medical assessments tied to given options. Moreover, the question’s specificity to the context and choices set makes it challenging to derive a clear ground-truth answer outside this format."
