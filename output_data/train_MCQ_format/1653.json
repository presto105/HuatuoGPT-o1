Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Ambiguous Answer**\n\nExplanation: The question itself meets the requirement for depth of reasoning, as it involves interpreting clinical data to determine the most likely treatment response. However, the evaluation focuses on whether the question has a unique and unambiguous correct answer. In this case, the correct answer provided, \"PD\" (Progressive Disease), indicates \"Progressive Disease\" without giving an explicit option for the provided response options (A, B, C, D). The \"Correct Answer: PD\" seems intended to match \"D. Progressive Disease,\" but the disconnect in the presentation could lead to confusion. Therefore, it raises ambiguity in providing a clear link between the options and the intended correct response."
