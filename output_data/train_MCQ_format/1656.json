Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "Evaluation: \"Pass\"\n\nThis question meets all the criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** Evaluating the likely treatment response for a patient with this specific clinical profile requires understanding the interactions between various clinical factors and how they influence treatment outcomes, particularly under targeted therapy for a complex case of metastatic EGFR-mutant adenocarcinoma. This reasoning is sufficiently deep to not be considered \"Too Simple.\"\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides enough detailed information about the patient's clinical profile, treatment type, and known mutations to point towards a Partial Response (PR) as the most likely outcome, making the correct choice unambiguous.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** This question can be reformulated into an open-ended format, such as: \"Given the patient's clinical profile, EGFR status, and current treatment with Gefitinib, what is the most likely treatment response?\" The details lead to a clear ground-truth answer, supporting reformulation.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 59 years old,Sex: F,Height: 140.9 cm,Body weight: 42.5 kg,BMI: 21.41,Smoking history: Never smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: Yes,Brain metastasis: Yes,EGFR status: E19del,T790M,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 1~49%,PD-L1 (22C3): 0%,PD-L1 (SP263): 1%,WBC: 5.76,Albumin: 4.0 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 1.53,Neutrophil: 3.65,LDH level: Unknown U/L,Treatment type: Targeted Therapy,Treatment regimen: Gefitinib,SNV mutations: APC,EGFR,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
