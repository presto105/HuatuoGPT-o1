Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the question is: \"Pass\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires knowledge of clinical response to immunotherapy, understanding of patient-specific factors (like PD-L1 expression level), and the ability to evaluate treatment outcomes, making it complex.\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question presents a clear choice with an established correct answer (\"Progressive Disease\"), making it unambiguous.\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated open-endedly by asking, for instance, \"Based on the clinical profile, what is the most likely treatment response to Nivolumab?\" allowing for explanation behind choosing \"Progressive Disease\" as the treatment response.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
