Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given multiple-choice question is \"Pass\". Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires a deep understanding of cancer treatment response and the specific mutations and characteristics of the patient's cancer to determine the most likely treatment response. This involves considering various factors such as the specific EGFR mutation (E19del) and its known response to targeted therapy with gefitinib, the presence of metastases, and other molecular alterations. Therefore, it is not \"Too Simple\".\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides detailed patient information and specifies a correct answer as \"SD\" (Stable Disease). The context allows for a clear understanding of why \"Stable Disease\" is the correct response based on the given clinical scenario, which involves analyzing the potential efficacy of gefitinib treatment in the presence of specific genetic alterations. Hence, it does not have an \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking something like, \"Based on the patient profile and current treatment scenario, what is the most likely clinical outcome following treatment with gefitinib?\" This would still lead to a clear, expected answer of \"Stable Disease\", given the evidence. Therefore, it is \"Reformulatable\".\n\nOverall, the question meets all the criteria for a \"Pass\".",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
