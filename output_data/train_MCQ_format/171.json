Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The question appears to meet the criteria for \"Depth of Reasoning\" because it involves interpreting clinical data and understanding how various factors influence cancer treatment responses, which requires a certain level of expertise. The question also provides a clear, correct answer option (B. Partial Response) that aligns with the treatment regimen and clinical profile provided, ensuring it does not fall under \"Ambiguous Answer.\"\n\nFurthermore, this multiple-choice question can be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking, \"Given the patient's clinical profile and treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response, and why?\" This reformulation would allow for detailed reasoning based on the provided clinical data and treatment specifics, maintaining a clear ground-truth answer.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation for this question is:\n\"Pass\"",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 70 years old,Sex: M,Height: 170 cm,Body weight: 60 kg,BMI: 20.76,Smoking history: Former smoker,Cancer stage: SqCC,Histology: squamous cell carcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,PD-L1 group: >50%,PD-L1 (SP263): 80%,WBC: 10.88,Albumin: 4.7 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 2.56,Neutrophil: 7.34,LDH level: 147.0 U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pembrolizumab,SNV mutations: EP300,FLCN,NOTCH1,NOTCH3,TP53,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: FGFR3,Splice variants: None,TMB: 5.5 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
