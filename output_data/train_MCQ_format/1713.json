Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The given question requires an evaluation of various clinical and genetic factors to determine the most likely treatment response to a targeted therapy in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma. The complexity lies in understanding the implications of the EGFR mutation, the PD-L1 expression, lack of metastases, and the response typically expected from the use of Gefitinib.\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves analyzing multiple patient characteristics and understanding how they relate to the treatment outcome. It requires knowledge of oncology and targeted therapy responses, indicating that the reasoning depth is adequate.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides four distinct options and specifies that the correct answer is \"Stable Disease,\" suggesting a unique and unambiguous correct answer is intended.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated to ask for a prediction of the treatment response based on the provided profile. However, one might argue whether it's truly open-ended given the constraints and the typical clinical outcomes associated with the parameters provided.\n\nBased on these considerations, the evaluation for this question is:\n\n\"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
