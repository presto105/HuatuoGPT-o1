Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "\"Ambiguous Answer\" \n\nThe given question presents a complex clinical scenario involving various biomarkers and treatment response predictions for a patient with adenocarcinoma, and it requires evaluation based on multifaceted clinical data. However, the choice of the \"correct\" answer as Stable Disease (SD) could be questioned due to the unpredictability often associated with treatment responses, especially in complex oncological scenarios involving immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Since responses to cancer treatments can be highly variable, the uniqueness and the unambiguity of the correct answer may be challenged, leading to ambiguity in determining the most accurate response."
