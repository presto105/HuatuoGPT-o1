Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given multiple-choice question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires a certain level of clinical knowledge and interpretation of various patient data points (e.g., cancer stage, PD-L1 expression, genetics, and treatment type) dealing with oncology, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. It is not too simple as it involves integrating multiple aspects of the clinical profile to determine the most likely treatment response.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The provided correct answer is \"Stable Disease (SD),\" which is a commonly used term in oncology to describe the response after treatment. The question does not indicate there could be multiple correct answers.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** This question can be reformulated into an open-ended question by asking, \"Based on the clinical profile and treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response for this patient?\" Therefore, it is feasible to reformulate into an open-ended format with a clear ground-truth answer.\n\nBased on these points, the evaluation for the question is:\n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
