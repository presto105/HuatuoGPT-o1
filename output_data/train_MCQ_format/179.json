Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation of the given question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires the interpretation of various clinical data points and oncological parameters to deduce the most likely treatment response. This involves a higher level of reasoning based on medical knowledge related to cancer treatment outcomes, considering multiple factors such as cancer type, metastasis presence, PD-L1 expression, and treatment regimen. \n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a clear set of clinical data and asks for the most likely treatment response, with \"Stable Disease\" (SD) provided as the correct answer. There is a unique and unambiguous answer based on the provided clinical profile.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question such as \"Based on the provided clinical profile, what is the most likely treatment response for the patient, and justify your reasoning?\" The data given can lead to a clear answer based on current clinical guidelines and practice.\n\nOverall, the question meets all the stipulated criteria.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation for this question is: \"Pass\"",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
