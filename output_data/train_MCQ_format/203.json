Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: CR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "\"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n\nThe given case involves a complex clinical scenario with multiple influencing factors including age, cancer type and stage, specific mutations, and current treatment regimen. However, predicting a \"Complete Response\" solely based on the provided data without additional context or clinical indicators is overly ambitious and does not reflect typical clinical decision-making. In clinical practice, a patient's response to chemotherapy can be unpredictable even with detailed genetic and clinical profiling. The answer being \"Complete Response\" is not unambiguously supported by the data since factors like current metastasis and typical response rates for this kind of cancer with chemotherapy suggest that outcomes tend to be partial responses, stable disease, or progressive disease. Thus, the answer seems ambiguously determined."
