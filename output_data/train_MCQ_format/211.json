Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given multiple-choice question is \"Pass\". Here's why:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires a deeper reasoning skill because it involves analyzing a complex clinical profile to predict treatment response, especially considering multiple variables such as patient demographics, cancer stage, specific mutations, treatment regimen, and biomarker levels.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a specific correct answer (Stable Disease) among the multiple-choice options, and there is no indication that multiple interpretations could lead to a different correct answer. Therefore, it is not ambiguous.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question, such as: \"Given the patient's clinical profile, what is the most likely response to the specified treatment regimen?\" This formulation has a clear ground-truth answer (Stable Disease).\n\nThe question meets all the defined criteria for evaluation.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 81 years old,Sex: F,Height: 154 cm,Body weight: 67 kg,BMI: 28.25,Smoking history: Never smoker,Cancer stage: SCLC,Histology: small cell carcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,WBC: 10.47,Albumin: 3.2 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 2.27,Neutrophil: 7.21,LDH level: 194.0 U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy + Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Atezolizumab/Etoposide/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: MEN1,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 3.2 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
