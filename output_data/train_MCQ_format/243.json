Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation of the given multiple-choice question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires a good depth of reasoning because it involves analyzing a detailed clinical profile, including the patient's cancer type, stage, genetic mutations, PD-L1 expression, treatment regimen, and various lab results to assess the most likely treatment response.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question specifies a correct answer (\"SD\" which likely stands for Stable Disease), indicating that there is an unambiguous correct choice based on the information provided, assuming the context is well-understood. However, \"SD\" does not match any of the presented answer options (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Therefore, this discrepancy leads to ambiguity.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could potentially be reformulated into an open-ended question asking for the most likely treatment response based on the provided clinical profile. A clear guideline or standard reference point would be necessary to determine a single ground-truth answer.\n\nSince the correct answer provided (\"SD\") does not correspond to any listed option (assuming SD stands for Stable Disease, which should correspond to option C), this discrepancy leads to ambiguity:\n\nThe evaluation is: **Ambiguous Answer**"
