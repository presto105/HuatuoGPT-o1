Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the given question, let's break down the criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires an evaluation of multiple factors, including age, smoking history, cancer stage, specific mutations and alterations, PD-L1 expression, TMB, and the treatment regimen to assess likely treatment response. These variables are complex and require comprehensive analysis, which indicates deeper reasoning is needed.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question presents four distinct options (A, B, C, D) regarding the potential treatment response. The correct answer is clearly indicated as \"PD\" (Progressive Disease), which does not leave room for ambiguity given the detailed profile provided.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated in an open-ended manner. For example: \"Based on the patient's clinical profile, molecular characteristics, and treatment regimen, predict the most likely treatment response.\" This format would still result in a clear and concise answer of \"Progressive Disease,\" which adheres to the specifics given.\n\nTherefore, the question meets all the criteria, and the appropriate evaluation for this question is:\n\n\"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
