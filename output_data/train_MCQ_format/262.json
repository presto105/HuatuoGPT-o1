Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate this multiple-choice question, let's consider the criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires evaluating a complex patient profile and understanding various factors such as histology, PD-L1 expression, mutation status, and treatment regimen to predict the likely treatment response. This level of analysis involves critical thinking and medical knowledge, satisfying the depth of reasoning criterion.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a detailed clinical profile and a specific prediction of treatment response, \"Stable Disease,\" which implies there is a single, reasoned answer based on the data given. There doesn't appear to be ambiguity regarding the correct response as long as the expectation of interpretation aligns with medical expertise. Therefore, it satisfies this criterion.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format, such as \"Given the clinical profile of this patient, what is the most likely treatment response?\" This allows for a descriptive answer, though it needs a grounding in clinical reasoning as per the multiple-choice options. Thus, it meets the criterion for reformulation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the question meets all the criteria.\n\nEvaluation: \"Pass\"",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 83 years old,Sex: M,Height: 170 cm,Body weight: 78 kg,BMI: 26.92,Smoking history: Former smoker,Cancer stage: SqCC,Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 1~49%,PD-L1 (22C3): 2%,WBC: 30.63,Albumin: 1.8 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 0.35,Neutrophil: 29.9,LDH level: 235.0 U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Paclitaxel/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: ARID1B,ERCC4,NFE2L2,TP53,CNV alterations: ALK(gain),AR(gain),BCL6(gain),CCND3(gain),CCNE1(gain),CDK6(gain),EGFR(gain),FGF23(gain),FGF6(gain),FGFR3(loss),KDM5A(gain),KRAS(gain),MDM4(gain),MYCN(gain),PIK3CA(gain),TFRC(gain),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 10.2 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
