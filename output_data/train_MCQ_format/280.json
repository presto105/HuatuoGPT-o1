Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the provided question against the given criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning**: The question is complex and involves assessing a patient's clinical profile, including factors like age, cancer histology, metastasis locations, blood test results, genetic mutations, and treatment regimen. The correct answer requires in-depth understanding of oncology, treatment response assessment, and the impact of various clinical factors.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer**: The question provides a clear correct answer, which is \"Stable Disease.\" Based on the provided clinical profile and treatment details, the expected treatment response is likely derived through substantial medical reasoning, leading to a specific outcome.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility**: The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking something like, \"Given this patient's clinical profile, what is the most likely treatment response?\" This format allows for the evaluation of the respondent's reasoning process to arrive at the conclusion of \"Stable Disease.\"\n\nOverall, the question requires deep reasoning, has an unambiguous correct answer, and can be reformulated into an open-ended question. \n\nEvaluation: \"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
