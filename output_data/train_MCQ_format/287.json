Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "Evaluation: Pass\n\nThe given question requires evaluation of numerous clinical factors, molecular characteristics, and treatment type to determine the most likely treatment response, satisfying the criterion for depth of reasoning. The correct answer (stable disease) is unambiguous due to the specific clinical profile and treatment regimen provided. Additionally, it is feasible to reformulate this question into an open-ended format, such as \"Given the clinical and molecular profile of the patient, predict the most likely treatment response to the provided regimen,\" which would necessitate a clear ground-truth answer based on the data provided.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 76 years old,Sex: F,Height: 151 cm,Body weight: 38 kg,BMI: 16.45,Smoking history: Current smoker,Cancer stage: SqCC,Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,PD-L1 group: 0%,PD-L1 (22C3): <1%,PD-L1 (SP263): <1%,WBC: 11.68,Albumin: 4.0 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 1.77,Neutrophil: 8.92,LDH level: Unknown U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy + Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pembrolizumab/Paclitaxel/Carboplatin/MK4830,SNV mutations: TP53,CNV alterations: CDKN2A(loss),CDKN2B(loss),FGF10(gain),IRS2(gain),JAK2(loss),LAMP1(gain),MYC(gain),PIK3CA(gain),PIK3CB(gain),RICTOR(gain),TFRC(gain),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 6.3 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
