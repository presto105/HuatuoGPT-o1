Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Pass**\n\nThe question meets all the criteria for evaluation:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The clinical profile requires integration of multiple data points, such as genetic mutations, metastasis presence, and PD-L1 status, to predict treatment response. This requires a deeper understanding of how these factors are likely to impact the patient's response to the given treatment regimen.\n   \n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides clear diagnostic and treatment information, leading to a unique and specific outcome regarding treatment response, which is \"Progressive Disease\" (PD) in this medical context.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could be reformulated into an open-ended problem by asking, \"Based on this clinical profile, predict the most likely response to treatment,\" with a clearly defined correct answer based on clinical reasoning and guidelines.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 61 years old,Sex: M,Height: 176 cm,Body weight: 71 kg,BMI: 22.91,Smoking history: Current smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: Adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 0%,PD-L1 (22C3): 0%,WBC: 13.49,Albumin: 4.3 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 3.06,Neutrophil: 9.08,LDH level: Unknown U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy + Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: KEAP1,KRAS,LZTR1,RB1,TP53,CNV alterations: FOXA1(gain),MYCN(gain),NFKBIA(gain),NKX2-1(gain),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 11.0 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
