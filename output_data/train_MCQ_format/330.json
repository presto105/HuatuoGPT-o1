Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "\"Pass\" \n\nThe given multiple-choice question requires a detailed understanding of the patient's clinical profile, including cancer histology, genetic mutations, and specific biomarkers such as PD-L1 and TMB, to infer the most likely treatment response. This requires deeper reasoning, rather than a straightforward recall of facts, thus satisfying the Depth of Reasoning criterion. The question has a unique and unambiguous correct answer, option C - Stable Disease (SD), ensuring that it meets the Unambiguous Correct Answer criterion. Lastly, the question can be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking, \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and the treatment regimen provided, what is the expected treatment response?\" This meets the Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility criterion.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 73 years old,Sex: F,Height: 154 cm,Body weight: 57 kg,BMI: 24.03,Smoking history: Never smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: Adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 0%,PD-L1 (22C3): 0%,PD-L1 (SP263): 0%,WBC: 3.84,Albumin: 4.6 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 1.02,Neutrophil: 2.43,LDH level: 252.0 U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pemetrexed/Cisplatin,SNV mutations: KRAS,NF2,SMAD4,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: NRG1,Splice variants: None,TMB: 22.8 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
