Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given question is:\n\n- \"Pass\"\n\n**Justification:**\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves a complex clinical profile that requires understanding various biomarkers and treatment regimen implications, indicating a depth of reasoning is needed to come to the conclusion of \"Stable Disease\" as the most likely treatment response.\n   \n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The correct answer, \"Stable Disease (SD),\" is clearly indicated, and the information provided supports differentiating between different response categories based on clinical criteria.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** This question can be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking, \"Given the patient clinical profile, what is the most likely treatment response and why?\" This allows for the expert to provide a rationale based on medical reasoning and available data, and it offers a clear ground-truth answer.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
