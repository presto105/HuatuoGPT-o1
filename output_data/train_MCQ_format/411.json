Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The question involves evaluating a cancer patient's potential response to a specific immunotherapy treatment regimen based on a detailed clinical profile, including factors such as PD-L1 expression, mutation status, and tumor mutational burden. Assessing the treatment response requires integration of this complex data, which aligns with the need for deep reasoning. The presence of multiple specific clinical parameters and their interplay suggests nuanced decision-making rather than a straightforward empirical rule, which would meet the depth of reasoning criterion.\n\nThe question specifies \"SD\" (Stable Disease) as the correct answer, indicating that the question anticipates a unique response to the treatment based on the provided patient details. This addresses the requirement for an unambiguous correct answer, as the clinical context given in the scenario supports the adjudged outcome.\n\nOpen-ended reformulation feasibility is met as the question can be rephrased to ask, \"Based on the provided clinical profile of the patient, predict the most likely response to Durvalumab treatment.\" This enables interpretation while still allowing for a clear answer grounded in clinical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation for this question is:\n\n\"Pass\"",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 75 years old,Sex: M,Height: 169.5 cm,Body weight: 68 kg,BMI: 23.67,Smoking history: Former smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 1~49%,PD-L1 (SP263): 10%,WBC: 6.22,Albumin: 4.1 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 1.18,Neutrophil: 3.57,LDH level: Unknown U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy,Treatment regimen: Durvalumab,SNV mutations: KRAS,RAF1,STK11,TP53,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 4.7 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
