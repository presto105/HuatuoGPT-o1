Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "Based on the provided criteria, the evaluation of the given question is: \"Pass.\"\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires evaluation of a clinical profile including various factors such as age, cancer histology, metastasis status, genetic mutations, PD-L1 status, blood markers, and treatment regimen to determine the most likely treatment response. This necessitates a deeper analysis of the interaction between genetic markers, treatment type, and cancer characteristics to infer response, rather than a straightforward question with easily deduced answers.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question asks for the most likely treatment response and provides that the correct answer is \"Progressive Disease.\" Based on the patient's cancer profile, stage, mutation status, and treatment provided, this answer is unique and unambiguous.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended problem by asking: \"Based on the provided clinical profile, what is the most likely treatment response for the patient, and why?\" This allows for a description rather than selecting from multiple choices, while still aiming for the same conclusion.\n\nThus, the question satisfies all the criteria necessary for it to receive a \"Pass\" evaluation.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
