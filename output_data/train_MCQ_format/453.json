Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the question based on the given criteria, we must ensure that the question requires depth of reasoning, has an unambiguous correct answer, and can be easily reformulated into an open-ended format.\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires the evaluation of a detailed clinical profile, understanding the implications of various biomarkers, and how they relate to the treatment outcome of immunotherapy and chemotherapy for a specific cancer type. This complexity is needed to determine the most likely treatment response. This indicates that deeper reasoning is involved beyond surface-level knowledge or facts.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The provided correct answer is \"PD\" (Progressive Disease). Given the complex clinical data, including PD-L1 status, genomic mutations, and treatment regimen, it seems to imply a specific clinical judgment regarding the likelihood of response. Although treatment response prediction can inherently have some uncertainty, the question presumes a definitive correct answer. Thus, from the information provided, it seems adequately framed to conclude there is an unambiguous answer.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could potentially be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking something like: \"Given this patient's detailed clinical and genetic profile, what is the most likely response to the treatment regimen of Pembrolizumab, Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin?\" This allows for an open-ended discussion that would still conclude with a predicted treatment response.\n\nSince the question requires in-depth analysis, assumes a unique correct answer from complex medical data, and can be reformulated into an open-ended question, it meets all criteria.\n\n**Pass**",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
