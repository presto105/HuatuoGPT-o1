Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: CR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The question requires assessing the clinical profile of a patient undergoing a specific treatment regimen and determining the likely treatment response, which involves considering multiple factors such as cancer type, treatment, and genetic markers. These elements collectively necessitate deeper reasoning.\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves understanding the implications of various clinical and genetic factors on treatment response, which requires significant depth in reasoning, especially in oncology.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question states \"Correct Answer: CR,\" indicating a complete response is expected. However, a complete response being the correct answer seems clinically unlikely given the patient's profile and status. Typically, such cases may not show a complete response, and without clear reasoning or data to absolutely support this outcome over others, the determination of \"Complete Response\" seems questionable and potentially ambiguous.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could potentially be reformulated into an open-ended question by asking for an analysis of expected treatment outcomes based on the provided profile and data.\n\nHowever, due to the unlikely clinical correctness of the \"Complete Response\" and potential ambiguity surrounding what truly constitutes the most plausible and supported answer, this is better classified as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n\nTherefore, the evaluation for this question is: \"Ambiguous Answer\"."
