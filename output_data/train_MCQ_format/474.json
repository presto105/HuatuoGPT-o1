Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The given multiple-choice question presents a comprehensive clinical profile of a cancer patient and asks for the most likely treatment response. Evaluating the criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** This question requires deeper reasoning. It involves understanding the patient's clinical profile, including cancer stage, treatment type, and specific genetic mutations and biomarkers. Determining the treatment response based on these factors requires knowledge of oncology and treatment protocols.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides an unambiguous correct answer of \"Partial Response (PR).\" Given the detailed patient information, it suggests that among the options, \"Partial Response\" is the most likely outcome based on the treatment regimen and clinical indicators.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question by asking: \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response?\" This can have a clear ground-truth answer of \"Partial Response,\" considering the same evaluation factors used for the multiple-choice format.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the question meets all the criteria.\n\nEvaluation: \"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
