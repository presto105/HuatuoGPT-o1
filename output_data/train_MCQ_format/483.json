Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given multiple-choice question is \"Pass\".\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves analyzing a detailed patient clinical profile, including cancer type, genetic mutations, treatment regimen, and other relevant factors such as PD-L1 status and smoking history. Concluding the most likely treatment response requires integration of these data points, which involves a deeper understanding of oncology and genetic markers. This requirement fulfills the \"Depth of Reasoning\" criterion. \n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The correct answer given is \"Stable Disease\" (SD), which is a standard classification in assessing response to cancer treatment and implies there is no significant change from baseline. The details provided (e.g., treatment targeting EGFR mutation, clinical stage, mutation status) lead to this specific outcome, satisfying the \"Unambiguous Correct Answer\" criterion.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** This question can be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking, \"Given the patient's clinical profile, what is the most likely treatment response to Lazertinib?\" The specific clinical details allow for deriving a clear answer through medical analysis. Thus, it satisfies the \"Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility\" criterion.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 70 years old,Sex: F,Height: 155.9 cm,Body weight: 55.5 kg,BMI: 22.83,Smoking history: Never smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,EGFR status: E19del,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 0%,PD-L1 (SP263): 0%,WBC: 13.95,Albumin: 4.1 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 2.43,Neutrophil: 10.58,LDH level: Unknown U/L,Treatment type: Targeted Therapy,Treatment regimen: Lazertinib,SNV mutations: ARID5B,EGFR,TP53,CNV alterations: EGFR(gain),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 3.9 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
