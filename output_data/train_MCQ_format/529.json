Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given multiple-choice question is \"Pass\".\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires deeper reasoning involving the interpretation of complex medical data including patient characteristics, histology, mutations, biomarker levels, and treatment regimen to predict a clinical response to immunotherapy. This is not a straightforward question and requires understanding of oncology and treatment responses.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a definitive correct answer (D. Progressive Disease), based on the provided clinical profile and treatment response data.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question, such as \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and selected treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response?\" This would require the same reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\nHence, the question meets all the criteria and is evaluated as \"Pass\".",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
