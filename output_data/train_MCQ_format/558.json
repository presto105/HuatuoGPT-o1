Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the given multiple-choice question, we can consider the following:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves understanding a detailed patient profile, including factors like PD-L1 expression, TMB status, and various genetic mutations, as well as interpreting the potential efficacy of a specific treatment regimen. Given the complexity of interpreting cancer treatment responses based on these myriad factors, we can consider this question to require deeper reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question specifies the correct answer as \"SD\" for \"Stable Disease.\" Based on the provided information, especially the PD-L1 expression being 0% and a low TMB of 1.6, which generally suggest limited benefit from immunotherapy like pembrolizumab, the option of stable disease seems reasonable given no contradictions in data. Thus, it has a unique and unambiguous correct answer.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could be reformulated into an open-ended question by asking something like: \"Based on the clinical profile and treatment regimen provided, predict the likely treatment response and justify your reasoning.\" This reformulation is feasible, as the necessary components for arriving at the \"stable disease\" conclusion are provided.\n\nGiven these considerations, the evaluation for this multiple-choice question would be: \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
