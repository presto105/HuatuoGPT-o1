Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: CR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the question is \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n\nThe given multiple-choice question is based on a clinical patient profile and seeks to determine the most likely treatment response to a targeted therapy involving Dabrafenib/Trametinib for a patient with certain genetic mutations and cancer histology. The correct answer is labeled as \"Complete Response\" (CR), but without specific knowledge of the clinical guidelines or responses associated with the BRAF mutation, in particular, the V600E mutation typically targeted by Dabrafenib, it is challenging to justify this as the definitive correct answer.\n\nWhile Dabrafenib and Trametinib are often used for BRAF V600E mutated cancers, typically associated with melanoma, responses in other cancers like lung adenocarcinoma may vary greatly. Moreover, treatment responses such as \"Complete Response,\" \"Partial Response,\" \"Stable Disease,\" and \"Progressive Disease\" would generally be determined by clinical imaging studies and other specific evaluation criteria rather than the information solely given in this profile.\n\nWithout additional context or the specific outcome measures used to assess response, the correct answer (\"Complete Response\") may not be uniquely justified, thereby making the question's answer ambiguous."
