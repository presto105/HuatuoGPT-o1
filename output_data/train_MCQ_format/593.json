Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the given multiple-choice question based on the outlined criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires the evaluator to assess various clinical and molecular factors such as age, cancer histology, metastasis, genetic mutations, PD-L1 expression, and treatment regimen to predict the treatment response. This requires a deeper understanding of oncology and the factors influencing treatment outcomes, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer. It is not a straightforward question and involves significant depth in reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a single correct answer, \"Stable Disease (SD),\" indicating a clear, definitive response. Based on the clinical scenario and the data given, the likely treatment response is not subject to dispute within the scope of the question.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could be reformulated into an open-ended format, such as \"Given the patient profile and treatment regimen, predict the most likely treatment response and justify your answer.\" The answer would still likely focus on \"Stable Disease\" with an explanation relating to how various factors could influence this outcome.\n\nThe question meets all the specified criteria. Therefore, the evaluation for this question is:\n\n- \"Pass\"",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 63 years old,Sex: M,Height: 170 cm,Body weight: 78 kg,BMI: 26.99,Smoking history: Current smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 1~49%,PD-L1 (22C3): 1%,PD-L1 (SP263): <1%,Albumin: Unknown g/dL,LDH level: Unknown U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pemetrexed/Cisplatin,SNV mutations: TP53,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
