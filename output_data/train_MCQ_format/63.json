Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires understanding multiple aspects of the patient's clinical profile, including histology, gene mutations, PD-L1 expression, and treatment regimen to determine the treatment response, which requires a considerable depth of reasoning.\n   \n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question specifies one correct answer, \"Progressive Disease,\" among the multiple-choice options provided.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question, such as \"Based on the provided patient clinical profile and treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response?\" with \"Progressive Disease\" as the clear, ground-truth answer.\n\nTherefore, the question meets all the criteria and is evaluated as \"Pass.\"",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
