Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the multiple-choice question provided, let's break down the criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The scenario presented gives detailed clinical data on a patient, including genetic information, cancer specifics, metastases, treatment regimen, and molecular markers. Determining the treatment response requires integrating these pieces of information, making it far from straightforward or simple. It requires knowledge of oncology, specifically in the context of ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma treatments and their typical efficacy.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question clearly asks for the most likely treatment response based on the provided data. However, there seems to be a misalignment as the \"Correct Answer\" is labeled \"PD\" which does not correspond with any of the answer choices (A, B, C, D). If \"PD\" stands for \"Progressive Disease,\" then option D should be the correct choice. Assuming this is a typographical oversight, the question otherwise provides a specific answer choice corresponding to the clinical scenario (progression despite treatment with Alectinib given the data presented).\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format, such as: \"Based on the clinical profile and treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response for this patient?\" Though open-ended, the question still requires a specific answer based on the clinical reasoning drawn from the data.\n\nBased on these points and assuming the typographical correction for the answer reference to \"Progressive Disease,\" the question would otherwise meet all the criteria. However, with current wording issues:\n\n- \"Ambiguous Answer\" (due to mismatched \"Correct Answer\" notation and answer choices)\n\nAssuming the resolution of the typographical error, it could be marked as a \"Pass.\" However, without this correction, the current form is ambiguous.",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
