Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the given multiple-choice question against the criteria, let's go through each one:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires interpretation of a complex cancer patient profile, considering their clinical and genetic characteristics (e.g., gene mutations, PD-L1 status, and TMB), and determining the most likely treatment response to a specific immunotherapy regimen. This involves an understanding of how these factors influence immunotherapy outcomes, which requires deep reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question specifies a correct answer \"PR,\" which stands for Partial Response. Given the detailed clinical data provided, the correct answer can be justified, suggesting it is not ambiguous.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can feasibly be reformulated into an open-ended question, such as \"Based on the clinical and genetic profile of this patient, what is the most likely response to the given immunotherapy?\" This would still allow for a specific ground-truth answer based on medical and scientific understanding, making it reformulatable.\n\nGiven these considerations, the evaluation for this question is:\n\n\"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
