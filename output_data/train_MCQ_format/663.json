Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The multiple-choice question requires an understanding of various clinical factors, treatment regimens, and genetic mutations to predict a cancer treatment response. Here's the evaluation based on the given criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires a detailed understanding of the factors influencing cancer treatment responses, such as histology, PD-L1 expression, genetic mutations, and TMB. This involves a complex medical knowledge base, making it not \"Too Simple\".\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question specifies \"SD\" (Stable Disease) as the correct answer, suggesting that the answer is unambiguous based on the given clinical profile and treatment details. Therefore, it's not \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format, asking for the most likely treatment response given the patient's clinical profile. An example of such reformulation could be: \"Given the detailed clinical profile of the patient, including age, cancer stage, metastases, genetic mutations, and treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response?\" This makes it suitable for open-ended reformulation and not \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the evaluation for the question is:\n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
