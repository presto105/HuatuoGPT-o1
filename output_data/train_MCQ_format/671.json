Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Pass**\n\nThe question involves examining detailed clinical data and understanding multiple factors that could influence the treatment response for a specific cancer profile. It requires deeper reasoning to assess the impact of various biomarkers, treatment type, and genetic mutations on the likely response to chemotherapy.\n\nThe answer provided is unique and unambiguous, as \"Stable Disease\" (SD) is indicated to be the correct response according to the provided information.\n\nThe scenario can be reformulated into an open-ended question by asking, \"Based on the given patient clinical profile, what is the most likely response to the pemetrexed/carboplatin treatment regimen?\" This allows for an analysis of the clinical details to arrive at the expected treatment outcome.\n\nTherefore, the question meets all the evaluation criteria.",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 48 years old,Sex: F,Height: 154.7 cm,Body weight: 66.1 kg,BMI: 27.62,Smoking history: Never smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: No,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: 0%,PD-L1 (SP263): 0%,WBC: 7.26,Albumin: 4.5 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 2.18,Neutrophil: 4.46,LDH level: 254.0 U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pemetrexed/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: KMT2A,MED12,TP53,CNV alterations: None,Fusion genes: NTRK1,Splice variants: None,TMB: 3.9 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
