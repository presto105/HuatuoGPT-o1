Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: CR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The given multiple-choice question can be evaluated as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves analyzing various clinical and molecular factors related to a cancer patient's profile and how these can influence treatment response to a specific targeted therapy (Crizotinib). Given that it requires an understanding of complex medical concepts, such as the influence of ROS1 positivity and PD-L1 expression, it demands deeper reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The correct answer provided is \"CR,\" which stands for Complete Response. However, the abbreviation \"CR\" is not explicitly part of the options (A. Complete Response, B. Partial Response, C. Stable Disease, D. Progressive Disease). Therefore, the answer does not accurately match the given options, which introduces ambiguity.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question, as it stands, can be reformulated into an open-ended question asking for the likely treatment response based on the patient's clinical profile and treatment regimen. However, due to the aforementioned issue with the unambiguous correct answer, confident reformulation is problematic.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the evaluation for this question is:\n\n\"Ambiguous Answer\""
