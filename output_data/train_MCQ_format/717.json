Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 75 years old,Sex: M,Height: 171 cm,Body weight: 56 kg,BMI: 19.15,Smoking history: Current smoker,Cancer stage: SqCC,Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,PD-L1 group: 1~49%,PD-L1 (22C3): 25%,PD-L1 (SP263): 35%,WBC: 11.82,Albumin: 3.7 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 1.78,Neutrophil: 8.8,LDH level: 449.0 U/L,Treatment type: Immunotherapy + Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pembrolizumab/Paclitaxel/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: None,CNV alterations: AR(loss),ATM(gain),CCND1(gain),FGF19(gain),FGF3(gain),FGF4(gain),FGF5(loss),FGFR1(gain),KIT(loss),MDM4(gain),NRG1(loss),PIK3CA(gain),PTPRD(loss),RICTOR(gain),SMAD4(loss),TFRC(gain),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 24.3 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
