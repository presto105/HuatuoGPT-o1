Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the given multiple-choice question, let's examine each criterion step-by-step:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning**: The question requires an understanding of patient clinical profiles, cancer biomarkers, and the implications of these on treatment response, which indicates a higher complexity suitable for advanced reasoning tasks. Therefore, it does not fall under \"Too Simple\".\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer**: The question suggests that the most likely treatment response is \"Progressive Disease,\" likely based on the clinical data provided, such as high LDH levels and specific mutations. It appears that this choice was made given the context and options, making it an unambiguous answer. Thus, it does not require marking it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility**: The question can be reformulated into an open-ended problem by asking, \"Based on the clinical profile, predict and justify the most likely treatment response for an 87-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma.\" This allows for providing a rationale behind the selected treatment response. Hence, it is reformulatable.\n\nConsidering all the factors, the given question is suitable for meeting the criteria: \"Pass\".",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2.
