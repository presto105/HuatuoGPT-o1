Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: CR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given multiple-choice question is \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves interpreting extensive clinical data, such as genetic mutations, metastasis, and treatment types, which requires a higher level of reasoning. Therefore, it does not fall under \"Too Simple\".\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question suggests that the correct answer is a \"Complete Response (CR)\". However, based on the clinical data provided - particularly presence of liver and brain metastases, ongoing gefitinib treatment, multiple mutations including TP53, and low TMB - a complete response seems unlikely. Clinical outcomes usually vary based on numerous factors and personalized treatment responses, making the assertion of a complete response questionable. Therefore, the correct answer is not unambiguously supported by standard clinical understanding, leading to ambiguity.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question involves nuanced clinical decision-making, which could be reformulated into an open-ended question such as \"Discuss the expected treatment response for this clinical profile, considering factors like EGFR status and metastasis.\" Therefore, it is reformulatable.\n\nWhile there is the potential to reformulate the question into an open-ended discussion, the ambiguity around the correct answer concerning treatment response makes this particular question fail the criteria. Thus, the main issue lies in the ambiguous nature of the supposed correct answer."
