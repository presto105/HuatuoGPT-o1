Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given multiple-choice question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires understanding the clinical profile, mutation status, and treatment regimen to determine the most likely treatment response for a complex medical condition like cancer. This requires integrating multiple clinical parameters, making it not \"Too Simple\".\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question indicates \"SD\" (Stable Disease) as the correct answer for the most likely treatment response based on the patient's profile and treatment details. Given the detailed information, the correct answer appears to be unique and unambiguous.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question, such as: \"Based on the clinical profile of the patient provided, what is the most likely treatment response to Pembrolizumab for this case of non-small cell lung cancer?\" This would still expect a clear, evaluated response based on given clinical details.\n\nHence, the question meets all the criteria for the evaluation.\n\n\"Pass\"",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
