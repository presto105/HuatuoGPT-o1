Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the given multiple-choice question based on the criteria provided:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires a comprehensive analysis of the patient's clinical profile, including interpreting complex clinical data such as mutation status, PD-L1 expression, and treatment regimen. This suggests that a deeper understanding of oncologic therapeutic responses is necessary, rather than a simple recall of facts.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a clear set of options and makes it explicit that the correct answer is \"Progressive Disease\" (PD). The reasoning behind this could be based on the specifics of the patient's genetic profile and typical responses to the mentioned targeted therapy, which may not typically result in complete or partial responses given the presence of mutations like TP53 that can lead to resistance. Thus, it appears to have an unambiguous answer based on the implied therapeutic context.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** This multiple-choice question could be reformulated into an open-ended question by asking, \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response?\" Thus, it is feasible for open-ended reformulation with a clear ground-truth answer.\n\nBased on these evaluations, the question appears to meet all the specified criteria, especially considering nuanced decision-making in oncology, which supports determining the correct treatment response based on gathered clinical data.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation for this question is: \n\n\"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
