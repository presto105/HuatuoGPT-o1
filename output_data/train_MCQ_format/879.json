Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "Evaluating the given question based on the provided criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires analysis of a detailed clinical profile, including cancer type, PD-L1 expression, genetic mutations, and treatment type, to predict the treatment response to Pembrolizumab. It involves understanding the implications of molecular markers and clinical features in immunotherapy, which demonstrates a deeper level of reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question specifies \"Correct Answer: PD\" and does not allow for multiple interpretations or correct answers. The answer \"Progressive Disease\" is given as the correct response.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format. For example, \"Given the detailed clinical profile of the patient, what is the predicted response to Pembrolizumab treatment?\" With a clear ground-truth answer being \"Progressive Disease.\"\n\nBased on these evaluations, the question meets all the criteria.\n\nEvaluation: \"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
