Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the multiple-choice question provided, let's analyze it against the given criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires understanding the patient's clinical profile and treatment regimen to predict the most likely treatment response. It involves knowledge of the significance of PD-L1 expression levels, especially over 50%, in relation to the effectiveness of pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug. This indicates a deeper level of reasoning is needed to infer the most likely response.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The correct answer provided is \"Progressive Disease.\" However, there is a potential discrepancy here. A PD-L1 expression level greater than 50% typically suggests a higher likelihood of a favorable response to pembrolizumab, such as partial response or stable disease, especially without any identified unfavorable factors like metastasis or mutations. The labeling of \"Progressive Disease\" as the correct answer appears questionable without additional context or information suggesting otherwise.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking, \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and treatment regimen, predict the most likely treatment response and justify your reasoning.\" This allows for detailed explanations and the application of clinical knowledge to justify the predicted response.\n\nGiven the likely ambiguity in what the correct answer should be, as a PD-L1 expression over 50% often indicates a good response to immunotherapy, the evaluation for the original question is:\n\n\"Ambiguous Answer\""
