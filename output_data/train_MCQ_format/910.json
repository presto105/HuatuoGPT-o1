Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "\"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 83 years old,Sex: M,Height: 167 cm,Body weight: 50 kg,BMI: 17.93,Smoking history: Former smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,WBC: 9.83,Albumin: 3.5 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 1.07,Neutrophil: 7.59,LDH level: 173.0 U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Pemetrexed/Cisplatin,SNV mutations: APC,BRCA2,KRAS,TBX3,TERT,TP53,CNV alterations: KRAS(gain),RPS6KB1(gain),Fusion genes: None,Splice variants: None,TMB: 12.6 mutations/Mb\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
