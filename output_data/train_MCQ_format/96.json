Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate this multiple-choice question, let's review the criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves assessing a patient's clinical profile, cancer characteristics, and treatment details to evaluate treatment response to Pembrolizumab. Determining the response requires understanding how PD-L1 expression and other factors influence outcomes in cancer treatment with immunotherapy, which involves a deeper level of reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a set of clinical details and requires selection from specific response categories (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). It claims a correct answer (\"PR\" for Partial Response) is given, suggesting an unambiguous response based on the information.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended question like \"Based on the clinical profile provided, what is the most likely treatment response to Pembrolizumab?\" This allows for an explanation and reasoning to be provided, which would have a clear ground-truth answer based on oncologic and treatment principles.\n\nBased on these assessments, the question passes the given criteria.\n\n**Evaluation: Pass**",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
