Complete Response\nB. Partial Response\nC. Stable Disease\nD. Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the question based on the given criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves analyzing a comprehensive clinical profile of a cancer patient, including factors like smoking history, cancer stage, various biomarker statuses (e.g., EGFR, ALK, ROS1), PD-L1 expression, blood parameters, and the treatment regimen, to predict the treatment response. This requires an understanding of oncology, especially how these variables interact and influence treatment outcomes. Thus, it requires deeper reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a specific list of treatment response options and requires selecting the \"most likely treatment response.\" The correct answer provided is \"Progressive Disease,\" which appears to be based on the clinical data and biomarker profiles suggesting likely resistance to treatment. This indicates a unique and unambiguous correct answer is expected.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated to an open-ended format asking, \"Based on the given patient clinical profile and treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response?\" This would allow for expert evaluation to arrive at a similar ground-truth answer (\"Progressive Disease\"), retaining clarity and context.\n\nGiven this analysis, the question meets all the criteria and is evaluated as:\n\n\"Pass\"",

The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer.
