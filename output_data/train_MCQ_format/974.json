Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: PR\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "To evaluate the provided multiple-choice question against the given criteria:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires the application of advanced medical knowledge concerning cancer treatment response, including understanding of how the presence of various biomarkers, mutations, and other clinical characteristics may affect the response to the specified chemotherapy regimen. This is not a simple recall question and does indeed require a deeper level of reasoning.\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question presents a clear clinical scenario with specific biomarkers and mutations and necessitates determining the most probable treatment response from the given options based on those clinical details. The correct answer is specifically given as \"PR\" (Partial Response), suggesting the options were carefully considered and a single correct answer is provided.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reformulated into an open-ended format, for example, \"Given the clinical profile of the patient and the treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response?\" This allows for a singular, well-supported answer based on provided data.\n\nGiven these points, the question satisfies all the criteria for complexity, clarity, and reformulation capability.\n\n**Evaluation: Pass**",
  "gpt_reformat_query": "I will provide you with a multiple-choice question, and your task is to rewrite it into an open-ended question, along with a Ground-True Answer. The requirements are:\n\n1. The question must be specific, targeting the point being tested in the original multiple-choice question. Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2. Based on the correct answer from the original question, provide a concise Ground-True Answer. The answer should allow for precise matching to determine whether the model's response is correct.\n\nHere is the multiple-choice question for you to rewrite:\n<Multiple-choice Question>\nPatient Clinical Profile:\nAge: 61 years old,Sex: F,Height: 163 cm,Body weight: 56 kg,BMI: 21.08,Smoking history: Never smoker,Cancer stage: Non SqCC,Histology: adenocarcinoma,Liver metastasis: No,Brain metastasis: Yes,EGFR status: Wild,ALK status: Negative,ROS1 status: Negative,PD-L1 group: >50%,PD-L1 (22C3): 60%,WBC: 15.86,Albumin: 4.1 g/dL,Lymphocyte: 0.81,Neutrophil: 14.24,LDH level: 334.0 U/L,Treatment type: Chemotherapy,Treatment regimen: Paclitaxel/Carboplatin,SNV mutations: CREBBP,CNV alterations: AR(gain),FGF10(gain),Fusion genes: RET,Splice variants: None\nWhat is the most likely treatment response?\nA.
