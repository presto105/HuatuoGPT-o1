    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's start with ALK-positive lung cancer. This is a specific type of non-small cell lung cancer where the cancer cells have this weird change, called a rearrangement, in the ALK gene. Oh, this makes them pretty unique and responsive to a specific kind of treatment known as ALK inhibitors. Basically, these drugs are like a key fitting perfectly into a lock, which stops the cancer cells from growing.\n\nNow, a drug called Alectinib comes into play. It's a second-generation ALK inhibitor. Second-generation? Yeah, that means it's an improved version compared to the first ones like crizotinib. It's designed to work even if the cancer tries to get smart with some resistance mutations. Pretty clever, right? Because of this, Alectinib usually works better – it has shown in studies that it helps in making tumors smaller and also keeps the cancer from getting worse for a longer time.\n\nSpeaking of these studies, what usually happens is that patients treated with Alectinib have high response rates. High response rate? That means many patients see their tumors shrink significantly. It could even mean a complete disappearance in some cases, though that's not as common. But hey, they still have great odds of seeing the tumor getting much smaller.\n\nOkay, so if you have ALK-positive status and you're getting Alectinib, the straightforward picture is that you'd see some solid shrinkage in the tumor. Like a partial response; the cancer isn't gone entirely, but it’s shrinking noticeably. This is much better than what would typically happen with the older drug, crizotinib, and it tends to last longer too.\n\nLet's wrap this up. For a patient being treated for ALK-positive adenocarcinoma with Alectinib, most likely you’d expect the cancer to shrink significantly. That's a partial response, based on how Alectinib works its magic by blocking the ALK protein and those pesky mutations. This is backed up by medical guidelines and recent studies too. So yeah, a positive outcome is pretty likely!\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the patient's clinical profile, including a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma with ALK-positive status and being treated with Alectinib, what is the most likely treatment response following this targeted therapy?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
