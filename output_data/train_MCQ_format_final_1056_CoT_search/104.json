    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this. This patient has adenocarcinoma, and I see that his PD-L1 expression is greater than 50%. That's a pretty strong indicator that pembrolizumab might work well for him. Why? Well, high PD-L1 levels often mean that the immune system can be revved up to attack the cancer cells.

It actually suggests that there are a lot of potential targets for the immune system to latch onto, which usually means the immunotherapy could be pretty effective here. More mutations mean more chances for the immune system to recognize something as foreign.\n\nAlso important is the fact that the cancer hasn't spread anywhere else in the body. No metastasis is a good sign; it usually means the cancer is at an earlier stage. In these cases, treatments are often more successful because there are fewer cancer cells to deal with, and they haven't spread to other places where it might be tougher to treat.\n\nAlright, moving onto genetic mutations. This is a bit trickier, but the general idea is that certain mutations might make pembrolizumab less effective.
