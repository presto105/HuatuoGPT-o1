    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this. Afatinib is a treatment option that directly relates to that pesky EGFR mutation in lung cancer cells, and this patient has the E19del mutation. Oh, that’s a well-known mutation which usually responds to EGFR-targeted therapies like Afatinib. Great start there, I’d say.\n\nNow, PD-L1 expression. This patient has a PD-L1 at 7%. Hmm, that number doesn’t sound very high, but those levels are more relevant when we're talking about immunotherapies. Afatinib works on a different mechanism, targeting the mutation directly, not the immune system.\n\nMoving on, the patient does have metastases in tough spots—the brain and the liver. That can sound a bit daunting, but there's some good news here. Afatinib and other similar drugs are designed to reach the brain too, so they can help manage those tricky brain metastases.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like the potential for this treatment to work well is quite high. With such a known sensitivity of the E19del mutation to Afatinib, and especially with its ability to work past the blood-brain barrier, this all looks promising.\n\nYes, I think I've got it. Given this specific mutation and the way Afatinib works, despite those metastases and the PD-L1 level, a positive response is very likely—maybe stabilization or even some reduction in disease.
