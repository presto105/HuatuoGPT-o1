It's pretty crucial to get the genetic lay of the land here since these specific mutations can really shape the treatment game plan.\n\nHmm, okay, so we know that mutations like EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 can make a huge difference for this type of lung cancer. If one of these is at play, there's a good chance there's a corresponding targeted therapy that could really help. There's also PD-L1 expression to think about, especially when we're talking about immunotherapy. If the expression is high, that's usually a good sign that the patient might respond well to those treatments also.\n\nNow, considering what treatments she might have had, if she's been on a targeted therapy like, let's say, an EGFR or ALK inhibitor and it worked well, that's a pretty strong clue that the mutation was present. But, we also should think about how she's currently doing on the treatment, and if there's any resistance building up over time because that happens surprisingly often.\n\nOh, and let's not forget the age factor here. At 79, the patient might not handle super aggressive treatments in the same way a younger person could. So, it's about finding that sweet spot where the treatment is effective, but not too harsh for her physically.\n\nSo, putting it all together, if we're dealing with one of these targetable mutations and she's received the right corresponding treatment, I'd bet we'd see a pretty good initial response. These targeted therapies are designed to hit those specific mutations hard, so the early results are often really positive.\n\nAnd yeah, confirming that with the real-world data we've got, it seems pretty logical that if she has a matching mutation and is on the right treatment, the early outcomes should be promising.
