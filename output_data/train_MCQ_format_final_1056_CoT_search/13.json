    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's look at this patient's situation. So, he's got non-small cell lung cancer, and I see that his PD-L1 expression level is over 50%. Typically, that's something that makes doctors think about using immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab, because there's usually a better response with high PD-L1 levels. But wait, he's not on immunotherapy; he's receiving Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. Hmm, I guess the PD-L1 status isn't going to be our main focus here since that mostly predicts the response to immunotherapies.\n\nNow, about that KRAS mutation. It's pretty common in cases like this, and I heard it doesn't really change how well chemotherapy works, at least not with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. It's true that KRAS mutations can complicate things when it comes to targeted therapies, making some of them less effective. But the good news is, these mutations don't typically mess with the standard chemotherapy approach for non-small cell lung cancer. In fact, KRAS mutations often respond okay to chemotherapy.\n\nConsidering the chemotherapy aspect, Pemetrexed and Cisplatin are like the tried-and-true combination for treating non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas, right? They tend to work fairly well in these cases. The patient being 82 might mean we have to keep an eye on how well he tolerates the treatment, but age aside, this regimen is still pretty standard.\n\nPulling it all together, even with the KRAS mutation, this guy's likely looking at a modest response to the chemotherapy. Yeah, the PD-L1 levels aren’t directly relevant here since they don't predict chemotherapy outcomes in the same way they do for immunotherapy. And while the KRAS status might have made us nervous if we were considering targeted treatments, it shouldn't be too much of an issue here.\n\nOverall, it seems like the standard Pemetrexed/Cisplatin treatment should give him a decent shot, but we should still keep the KRAS mutation in the back of our minds just in terms of prognosis. It sounds like he's got room for a reasonably effective response, even with these factors at play.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the clinical profile of the 82-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma, a PD-L1 expression level of 60%, KRAS mutation, and undergoing Pemetrexed/Cisplatin chemotherapy, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
