Ah, now notice, he doesn't have liver or brain metastasis, which usually would be quite a troubling factor, so that's a bit of a relief.\n\nOkay, now let's think about PD-L1 expression here. It's sitting at 10%. Not super high, that's for sure, but it does mean there's some room for immunotherapy to work.

Usually, higher numbers are better, since they often mean a better response, but I guess 10% is still decent enough to expect some kind of benefit.\n\nAnother thing is, because he's a smoker, there's a good chance his tumor may have more mutations. This might actually be a silver lining since a higher tumor mutational burden can mean better recognition by the immune system when using immunotherapy. So that's something in his favor.\n\nNow, let's talk about pembrolizumab itself. It's an anti-PD-1 antibody, and it's been pretty effective in non-small cell lung cancer cases, more so when PD-L1 is expressed, even if just at some level like 10%. Given everything else is stable, like no brain or liver metastasis complicating things, it seems like he could probably see some kind of partial response. Or, maybe things could stay stable; both outcomes would be pretty good here.\n\nSo, taking it all into account—and of course, these things can vary a bit—it seems like our guy here could very likely have a partial response or maybe stable disease with this treatment.
