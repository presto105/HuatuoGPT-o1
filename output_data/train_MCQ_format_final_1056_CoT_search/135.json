Okay, so that means EGFR-targeted therapies aren't in the cards for him. No big deal, there's more in the toolbox.\n\nNow, let's check out the PD-L1 expression. It's sitting at 10% on the SP263 test. Hmm, this isn't super high but definitely not zero. From what I've read, some PD-L1 expression means immunotherapy could be helpful here. So even though 10% is kind of moderate, that's enough to get us thinking about PD-1/PD-L1 drugs.\n\nNow onto the treatment regimen. We've got Pembrolizumab in the mix. Perfect, since it targets PD-1. And there's Pemetrexed and Carboplatin, the chemo duo. Combining immunotherapy with chemo is like covering all bases - it should give us a pretty good shot at a positive response. Patients usually respond better when these are combined, even if their PD-L1 levels aren’t sky-high.\n\nBut wait, let's keep his age in mind. He's 78, so we need to be thoughtful about side effects and how he might handle treatment. Older patients can do okay with immunotherapy, but we have to keep close tabs on them and adjust as needed.\n\nSo putting all this together, given his moderate PD-L1 expression and the strong combo of drugs, I'm betting on a partial response. That means his tumor could shrink, and he'll probably feel some symptom relief. All things considered, that's a realistic outcome based on similar cases I've seen and read about.\n\nI'm feeling pretty confident about this conclusion.
