    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's look at what's going on with this patient. So, we've got a 74-year-old man who is dealing with non-small cell lung cancer. That's tough, but we're not in the dark here because we know he has an EGFR L858R mutation. Now, from my understanding, this specific mutation is pretty common in cases of lung cancer like this and it makes the cancer cells susceptible to certain treatments.\n\nAh, yes, Afatinib! That's the treatment in question here. It's a second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This means it's really good at latching onto the EGFR, stopping the cancer cells from getting their signaling fix, which they need to grow and spread. Neat, right? What's particularly cool is that Afatinib doesn't just play with one receptor but goes after multiple in the ErbB family. That makes it quite comprehensive.\n\nNow, what about the PD-L1 level? I see it’s 0%. This number usually matters a lot when we’re talking about immunotherapy options, like those PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. But here, since we're focusing on Afatinib, it doesn't seem like PD-L1 is our priority. After all, Afatinib isn't relying on the body's immune response the way those other drugs do, so the PD-L1 level of 0% isn't a big deal in this context.\n\nHmm, considering his age - 74 years old - there might be some concern about how well he can handle Afatinib. Older age sometimes correlates with a tougher time dealing with drug side effects. But, really what we're mostly concerned about here is the effectiveness against the tumor, not just tolerance, right?\n\nSo, thinking it through, with the EGFR L858R mutation in the picture, there's a good chance this patient will respond well to Afatinib. It’s almost like having a key that fits the lock perfectly. This mutation is a big thumbs up for the efficacy of Afatinib, saying 'yes, this should work.’\n\nLet me make sure I’ve got this right. The science backs up that EGFR mutations like L858R make the cancer cells particularly primed for attack by EGFR TKIs such as Afatinib. That’s consistent with what we know. So, in conclusion, it’s a strong likelihood that the patient will see a positive effect from this treatment, given the mutation and the nature of the drug.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the clinical profile of a 74-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma and specific genetic alterations including an EGFR L858R mutation and a PD-L1 level of 0%, who is undergoing targeted therapy with Afatinib, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
