Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation of the given question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires the interpretation of various clinical data points and oncological parameters to deduce the most likely treatment response. This involves a higher level of reasoning based on medical knowledge related to cancer treatment outcomes, considering multiple factors such as cancer type, metastasis presence, PD-L1 expression, and treatment regimen. \n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a clear set of clinical data and asks for the most likely treatment response, with \"Stable Disease\" (SD) provided as the correct answer.
