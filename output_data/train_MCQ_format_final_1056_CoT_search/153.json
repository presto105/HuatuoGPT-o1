    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's start by thinking about this patient's situation one step at a time. They've got this EGFR E19del mutation, which is pretty common in some cases of non-small cell lung cancer. So with that type of mutation, Osimertinib is typically the go-to drug. Why? Because it's specifically designed to target these types of EGFR mutations and it’s a third-generation TKI, which means it should be quite effective.\n\nNow, let's talk about this PD-L1 thing. The patient's PD-L1 expression is at 5%. Hmm, so PD-L1 is usually talked about when we're considering immunotherapy since it helps predict how well someone might respond to that kind of treatment. But wait a minute, since we're dealing with Osimertinib here, which tackles the EGFR mutation directly, the PD-L1 expression isn’t really crucial for this specific treatment. But good to keep in mind for future treatment options if we were to think about immunotherapy.\n\nAlright, back to Osimertinib and the EGFR mutation. This medicine has a reputation for having a high response rate for those with EGFR mutations, like this E19del. So what usually happens? In most cases, you see a partial response. That's when you'd notice a significant shrinkage in tumor size, though it doesn't entirely disappear. Kind of like, you’re seeing progress but not a complete clearance.\n\nLet’s think about this - the scenario mentions that metastases have shrunk. That's a sign, right? Doesn’t necessarily mean it’s gone, but definitely reduced. This lines up perfectly with what we would expect from a partial response to Osimertinib in a patient like this.\n\nSo taking all of this into account, logically, it makes sense to conclude that the clinical response we’re looking at is partial. The tumors have shrunk but haven't completely vanished, which sounds spot on with everything we know about Osimertinib's effects and EGFR E19del mutations. Yep, feeling pretty confident about that conclusion!\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the patient profile with characteristics such as EGFR E19del mutation, PD-L1 expression of 5%, and treatment with Osimertinib, what is the most likely clinical response indicated by a reduction in the size of metastases without complete elimination?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
