    "<Internal Thinking>\nSo, I'm thinking about EGFR mutations and their role in cancer. These mutations are pretty common in non-small cell lung cancer, especially in the adenocarcinoma type. When we talk about something like an exon 19 deletion, or E19del, it's basically a change that makes the EGFR pathway overly active. This isn't good because it makes cancer cells grow more than they should.\n\nOh, and let's talk about Gefitinib. It's one of those drugs called EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which sounds super technical. But what it does is pretty straightforward— it targets and blocks the overactive EGFR pathway. By doing this, it stops the cancer cells from getting the constant 'go-ahead' signal to grow and divide. This is particularly true in cancers with EGFR mutations like the E19del. Hmm, interesting!\n\nNow, if a patient has this specific kind of mutation, and they start on Gefitinib, what's the usual outcome? Well, studies have shown, and it seems widely accepted, that these patients usually respond really well to Gefitinib. Often, there's a significant reduction in tumor size, which is pretty amazing. You know those scans doctors look at? They often show the tumor shrinking or at least not growing anymore.\n\nOkay, let's think about how we know if the treatment is working. Doctors would typically see a partial or even complete response of the tumor when using Gefitinib in these cases. That's a big deal since it means the treatment is actively fighting the cancer. And yeah, it's backed by many studies— patients with these mutations generally show good responses with this drug.\n\nSo, wrapping it all up, for a 65-year-old woman with adenocarcinoma and this E19del mutation, being treated with Gefitinib, the most likely scenario is that the tumors shrink or stop growing.
