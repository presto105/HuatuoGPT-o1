    "<Internal Thinking>\nSo, we're dealing with a 77-year-old female patient who has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, specifically a non-squamous type of non-small cell lung cancer. Her cancer stage isn't explicitly mentioned, but it's serious enough to warrant chemotherapy. Let's talk about her PD-L1 expression level; it's somewhere between 1% and 49%. Now, that's interesting because this level could have implications for her treatment options. PD-L1 is a protein that, when expressed at higher levels, can make cancer cells more responsive to immunotherapy treatments like pembrolizumab. But since it's not that high, it suggests that while immunotherapy might be an option, the doctors seem to have chosen a different path with chemotherapy.\n\nLooking at her chemotherapy regimen, she's on Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. This combination is pretty common for non-squamous NSCLC. Pemetrexed is particularly effective for the kind of cancer she has, and Cisplatin is a well-established choice for advanced cancers, often used in the first-line setting. These two are like the dynamic duo of chemotherapy for this type of cancer.\n\nThinking about what's possible here, we should consider the potential outcomes. In patients similar to her, treated with this regimen, the results can vary. Some might experience what's called a partial response, where the tumors shrink but don't disappear entirely. Others might see stable disease, which means the cancer isn't necessarily shrinking, but it's not growing either. Complete cures are rare with this kind of treatment, but the goal is to manage the disease.\n\nLet's put everything together. Considering her specific cancer type, the PD-L1 expression level, and her chemo regimen, what we're likely to see is a partial response or maybe the cancer will just stabilize. The PD-L1 expression level might hint at potential benefits from immunotherapy, but it's not high enough to be a sure thing on its own without some form of chemotherapy.\n\nYes, this makes sense. Based on data from clinical trials and typical outcomes, expecting a partial response or stabilization isn't far-fetched.
