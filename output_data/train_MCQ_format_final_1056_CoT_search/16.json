Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

It is particularly used in cases where the cancer demonstrates these types of mutations.\n\n### Effectiveness of Afatinib in brain metastases\nAfatinib has shown some ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which is beneficial for treating brain metastases.

Your task is to rewrite the <Thought Process> to resemble a more human-like, intuitive natural thinking process. The new version should:\n\n1. Be presented as step-by-step reasoning, with each thought on a new line separated by a line break.\n2. Avoid structured titles or formatting, focusing on natural transitions. Use casual and natural language for transitions or validations, such as \"hmm,\" \"oh,\" \"also,\" or \"wait.\"\n3. Expand the content, making the reasoning richer, more detailed, and logically clear while still being conversational and intuitive.\n\nReturn directly the revised natural thinking in JSON format as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"NaturalReasoning\": \"...\"\n}\n```"
