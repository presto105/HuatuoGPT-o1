    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's see what we have here. This patient has squamous cell carcinoma. I know that squamous cell carcinomas, especially in older patients, can be pretty tough to treat. Hmm, but there's something interesting here—the high PD-L1 expression. From what I recall, tumors with high PD-L1 tend to respond better to certain immunotherapies, because PD-L1 is like a signal that helps the cancer hide from the immune system, and blocking it can unleash the immune cells against the tumor.\n\nNow, let me think about Pembrolizumab. This drug acts by targeting PD-1, basically lifting the brakes off T-cells, allowing them to attack cancer cells more aggressively. So, that's a standard go-to drug for cases like these where there's high PD-L1. It really seems fitting as it aligns with the patient’s PD-L1 status.\n\nThen we have MK7684A. Now this one is not as widely known as Pembrolizumab but I remember it’s in trials and involves some combination therapy targeting multiple pathways. It's pretty intriguing because these combination therapies can sometimes enhance the anti-tumor effect, kind of like a double hit on the tumor’s survival tricks.\n\nGiven this information, let's think about potential outcomes. When immune checkpoint inhibitors are in play, especially with highly expressing PD-L1 tumors, the expectation is usually that the immune system will kick in stronger. So we could expect to see some reduction in tumor size or at the very least, the disease might stabilize, meaning it's not progressing further.\n\nOkay, after piecing this together, the response to these treatments, taking into account the patient's high PD-L1 expression, could very well be a partial response where the tumor shrinks or stabilizes. It makes sense, right? Because that's consistent with how these drugs are supposed to work in such scenarios.\n\nI'm pretty confident in this conclusion since I've seen studies and heard about cases where similar approaches brought about these types of responses. So yeah, that's what I'd anticipate as the most likely outcome.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of an 87-year-old male patient with squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), high PD-L1 expression, specific somatic mutations, and ongoing immunotherapy treatment with MK7684A or Pembrolizumab, what is the most likely treatment response in terms of disease status?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
