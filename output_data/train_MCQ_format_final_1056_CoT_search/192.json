It reflects a balanced consideration of all factors, suggesting it is accurate.\n</Thought Process>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 40-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma, defined by current smoking status, absence of liver and brain metastasis, wild-type EGFR, negative ALK and ROS1 status, PD-L1 expression between 1% and 49%, and a treatment regimen combining Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Durvalumab, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Thought Process> above reflects the model's reasoning based on the <Question>. Your task is to rewrite the <Thought Process> to resemble a more human-like, intuitive natural thinking process. The new version should:\n\n1. Be presented as step-by-step reasoning, with each thought on a new line separated by a line break.\n2. Avoid structured titles or formatting, focusing on natural transitions. Use casual and natural language for transitions or validations, such as \"hmm,\" \"oh,\" \"also,\" or \"wait.\"\n3. Expand the content, making the reasoning richer, more detailed, and logically clear while still being conversational and intuitive.\n\nReturn directly the revised natural thinking in JSON format as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"NaturalReasoning\": \"...\"\n}\n```"
