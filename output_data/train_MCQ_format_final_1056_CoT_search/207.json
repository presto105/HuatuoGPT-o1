Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this. We're dealing with a 71-year-old woman who has ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. This type of lung cancer is known to respond to targeted therapies. Hmm, since she’s taking Crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor, that makes sense because it targets the specific protein driving her cancer growth.\n\nNow, Crizotinib is pretty well-known for its effectiveness in shrinking the primary tumor and controlling disease progression—at least initially. Patients often see a promising reduction in tumor size, which sounds great! But here’s the catch: Crizotinib doesn’t cross the blood-brain barrier very well.\n\nOh, right, she also has brain metastases. This is where things get a bit tricky.

It just doesn’t penetrate the brain effectively enough to manage metastases there, so that’s a limitation.\n\nSo, if the aim is to control those pesky brain metastases, we might need to consider additional treatments. What could those be? Maybe something like whole-brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery—those are often paired with Crizotinib for more comprehensive treatment.\n\nIn summary, I’d expect her primary lung cancer to respond well to Crizotinib at first, showing a noticeable reduction in size. However, for the brain metastases, the response might be underwhelming unless we add other therapies into the mix. This aligns with what we know and see in clinical guidelines about managing this kind of cancer.
