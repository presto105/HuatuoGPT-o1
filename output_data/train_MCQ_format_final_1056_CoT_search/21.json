    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so we've got a 75-year-old man here with lung adenocarcinoma, and I'm trying to figure out how he might respond to the treatment he's on. He doesn't have any metastasis to his liver or brain, which is definitely a good thing. First off, let's talk about the biomarkers. He's negative for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1, and his PD-L1 expression is at 0%. Hmm, these are important because if he had positive markers, he could benefit from certain targeted therapies or immunotherapies. But since they're negative, those aren't options for improving his odds right now. \n\nConsidering his treatment plan, he's on Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. That's a pretty common choice for someone with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer like adenocarcinoma, especially when there aren't specific mutations to target. From what I know, this regimen is known for being relatively effective while also being tolerable, which matters a lot at his age. Speaking of age, he's 75, which can sometimes mean a person might not handle chemotherapy as well, but this combination is usually okay. Plus, his BMI of 21.97 suggests he's not overweight, maybe even a bit lean, which can be a factor in how he handles treatment too. \n\nNow, thinking about how he might respond, since he doesn't have those actionable mutations or PD-L1 expression, he's really counting on this chemotherapy to do the heavy lifting. Pemetrexed and Cisplatin are known to improve outcomes in cases like his, though the best response is often partial, meaning the cancer shrinks but doesn't completely go away. Stable disease, where the cancer doesn't grow, is also a possibility. I doubt a complete response to the treatment because those are pretty rare, especially without targeted therapies. \n\nCombining all this, I think it's most likely that his best-case scenario with Pemetrexed/Cisplatin is a partial response or at least stabilization of his disease. This approach is well-supported by the latest treatment guidelines and research for someone with his cancer profile, so it lines up with current medical understanding.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the clinical profile of a 75-year-old male patient with a BMI of 21.97, adenocarcinoma (Non SqCC) with no metastasis to liver or brain, negative EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 statuses, a PD-L1 group of 0%, and undergoing chemotherapy with Pemetrexed/Cisplatin, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
