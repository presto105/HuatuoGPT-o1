    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so let's figure out what's going on with the patient. We've got a 67-year-old woman dealing with adenocarcinoma, which is a type of lung cancer. Now, what's interesting is that she's ROS1 positive, meaning there's this specific genetic factor in play.\n\nNow, the treatment she's currently on is Pemetrexed combined with Cisplatin. That's a pretty standard regimen for advanced lung cancer, but here's the kicker: when you've got this ROS1 positivity, it opens the door to some more tailored treatments.\n\nOkay, let's talk options. For ROS1-positive lung cancer, targeted therapies like Crizotinib can be the real game-changer. They've been shown to work better than just going with chemotherapy alone in these cases. So, where Pemetrexed/Cisplatin might help, it's not really zeroing in on that ROS1 rearrangement.\n\nClinical trials have been pretty clear about this—ROS1 inhibitors like Crizotinib tend to lead to better results, like improved progression-free survival, which basically means patients can stay healthier for longer periods without the cancer getting worse.\n\nSo, from where I stand, while the current treatment might bring about some benefit, it's more of a general approach. For someone who's ROS1-positive, a targeted therapy could be the way to go. It aligns more with what such a genetic profile responds well to.\n\nTypically, when doctors find that ROS1 rearrangement, there's a good chance they'd recommend moving toward targeted therapies sooner rather than later. But hey, there could be reasons for sticking with the current regimen for now—could be the patient's specific situation or maybe just personal choice.\n\nAll in all, it seems like for this patient, switching to something like Crizotinib might not just be an option—it's advisable for getting the best possible outcome. That's really about using the most effective tools for her unique case.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 67-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma, ROS1 positive status, and undergoing Pemetrexed/Cisplatin chemotherapy, what is the most likely treatment outcome?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.

    "Given the clinical profile of a 67-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma and ROS1-positive status, currently undergoing Pemetrexed/Cisplatin chemotherapy, the most likely treatment outcome could be moderate to limited effectiveness. While Pemetrexed and Cisplatin can provide some benefit and are commonly used in non-small cell lung cancer, they are not specifically targeting the ROS1 genetic rearrangement.\n\nIn cases of ROS1-positive lung cancer, targeted therapies like Crizotinib are generally more effective. These targeted treatments are designed to specifically inhibit the ROS1 protein, potentially leading to improved outcomes such as longer progression-free survival and enhanced quality of life compared to standard chemotherapy alone.\n\nTherefore, while the current treatment regimen may help manage the disease to some extent, transitioning to a targeted therapy like Crizotinib is advisable for achieving better outcomes tailored to the patient's genetic profile. This switch could significantly improve the patient's prognosis and is typically recommended once ROS1 positivity is identified."
