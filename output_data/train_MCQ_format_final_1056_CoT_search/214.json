EGFR mutations are common targets for TKIs like Gefitinib. The presence of the T790M mutation often leads to resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKIs like Gefitinib, indicating a complex scenario.\n\n### Treatment Implications of EGFR Mutations\nEGFR mutations such as E19del are generally sensitive to EGFR-TKIs. However, the T790M mutation is a known resistance mechanism to drugs like Gefitinib. The presence of both mutations indicates that while initial response might be favorable due to E19del, resistance may develop due to T790M.\n\n### Impact of Gefitinib\nGefitinib is a first-generation EGFR-TKI typically used in EGFR-positive NSCLC. Given the patient's history of the T790M mutation, it might be expected that Gefitinib will not be effective in the long term, although temporary response may occur due to the E19del mutation.\n\n### Considering the PD-L1 Expression\nPD-L1 expression of 1~49% does not strongly suggest highly responsive immune checkpoint blockade therapy; however, it offers another therapeutic angle if targeted therapy fails.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile initially the patient might show a positive response to Gefitinib due to the E19del mutation, the presence of T790M is likely to lead to eventual treatment resistance. Therefore, the most likely treatment response is a mixed response with initial effectiveness but subsequent resistance due to the T790M mutation.\n\n### Verification\nThe previous conclusion suggests an initial response with eventual resistance due to T790M, but this overlooks the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib, which targets T790M. This offers a potential avenue for effective treatment despite the T790M mutation. Therefore, the conclusion may not be comprehensive and needs reassessment.\n\n### Understanding T790M Mutation\nThe T790M mutation in EGFR is a resistance mechanism against first-generation EGFR-TKIs like Gefitinib. However, third-generation EGFR-TKIs such as osimertinib specifically target this mutation, offering an effective treatment approach.\n\n### Current Treatment with Gefitinib\nThe patient is currently on Gefitinib, which is suitable for sensitizing mutations like E19del, but likely ineffective against T790M, suggesting that if the T790M mutation is present, switching to a different therapy may be necessary.\n\n### Potential Role of PD-L1 Expression\nThe patient's PD-L1 expression is 1~49%, indicating moderate levels that might not strongly predict response to immunotherapy. Therefore, the primary focus should be on targeted therapy.\n\n### Optimal Treatment Strategy\nGiven the presence of the T790M mutation and the ineffectiveness of Gefitinib against it, the optimal treatment strategy should likely involve switching to osimertinib, which effectively targets both E19del and T790M mutations.\n\n### Conclusion\nConsidering the patient's EGFR mutations, particularly T790M, and current treatment with Gefitinib, the most likely optimal treatment response would involve switching to osimertinib due to its proven efficacy in targeting T790M and providing a more sustained response.\n\n### Verification\nAlthough the final conclusion suggested that switching to osimertinib might be optimal due to the T790M mutation, the question asks about the likely treatment response of the current therapy with Gefitinib. Therefore, the previous conclusion focuses on the recommended treatment change rather than evaluating the current treatment response. This makes the conclusion false.\n\n### Impact of Gefitinib on E19del\nGefitinib is an effective first-generation EGFR-TKI for patients with E19del EGFR mutations, often resulting in an initial positive response in terms of tumor reduction or disease stabilization.\n\n### Resistance due to T790M Mutation\nHowever, the presence of T790M mutation is a well-known resistance mechanism against first-generation EGFR-TKIs like Gefitinib. This suggests that initial effectiveness might be compromised, and resistance could occur.\n\n### Clinical Implications of Current Treatment\nSince the patient is currently on Gefitinib, initial signs of response could be seen due to the E19del mutation, but subsequent resistance and disease progression are likely because of the T790M mutation, unless there is a treatment change.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe most likely treatment response with the current therapy of Gefitinib is an initial partial response or stabilization due to the E19del mutation, followed by acquired resistance and disease progression due to the T790M mutation, necessitating consideration for a treatment change.\n\n### Verification\nThis conclusion accurately discusses the likely clinical response of the patient based on the current treatment with Gefitinib, considering both the presence of E19del and T790M mutations.

    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through. We have a 71-year-old woman dealing with non-squamous cell carcinoma, specifically adenocarcinoma, and it has unfortunately spread to her brain. That's quite concerning on its own. Now, she's got a history of specific mutations in the EGFR gene, namely E19del and T790M. These mutations can really inform how we approach her treatment. Now, E19del is kind of a good news scenario in terms of treatment because tumors with this mutation tend to respond well to drugs like Gefitinib. This drug is a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI for short. It's designed to target those pesky EGFR mutations and can be quite effective initially. \n\nBut here's the catch - she also has this T790M mutation. This particular mutation is notorious for causing resistance to first-generation TKIs like Gefitinib. So, while E19del might make it look like Gefitinib will work fantastically at first, T790M is like a sneaky little gremlin that's ready to sabotage things down the line. Essentially, you might start off with some positive changes, maybe some tumor shrinkage or stabilization, but the presence of T790M means there's a ticking clock on how long Gefitinib will actually work before resistance kicks in.\n\nAnother layer to this is her PD-L1 expression, which sits at 1~49%. So, not super high but not zero either. PD-L1 levels can sometimes offer insight into the likelihood of responding to immunotherapy. However, with these levels, it doesn't scream highly responsive, but it does leave the door open a crack for considering immune checkpoint inhibitors if targeted therapy fails. \n\nGiven all this, one might be tempted to jump straight to changing treatment, especially considering third-generation TKIs like osimertinib have been developed to specifically tackle that pesky T790M mutation. Osimertinib would probably be a solid choice if resistance to Gefitinib becomes apparent because it can address both E19del and T790M mutations effectively. \n\nNow, if we're focusing purely on what's likely to happen with her current treatment of Gefitinib, I’d say, initially, you are likely to see some level of response due to the E19del mutation - perhaps partial response or disease stabilization. But this window of effectiveness is shadowed by the likelihood of developed resistance over time, owing to the T790M mutation. \n\nUltimately, with the current Gefitinib therapy, I'd expect an initial positive response, but it would likely be followed by resistance and disease progression, at which point a reevaluation of her treatment plan would be necessary, probably shifting towards osimertinib for a more sustained response. That conclusion feels consistent with what we'd expect given her mutational profile.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 71-year-old female patient with non-squamous cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma), brain metastasis, a history of EGFR mutations (E19del and T790M), negative ALK status, PD-L1 group of 1~49%, and currently receiving targeted therapy with Gefitinib, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
