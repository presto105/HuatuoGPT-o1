Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about this for a minute. We have an 87-year-old gentleman here dealing with small cell lung cancer. Age definitely comes into play. I think about all the typical issues concerning older patients, like other health conditions that might be lurking around and how their bodies handle treatment differently than younger folks.\n\nSmall cell lung cancer, from what I've seen, is quite aggressive. But strangely enough, it's one of those cancers that can respond really well to chemo, which is interesting. So, I've got to consider the usual suspects like etoposide and platinum-based drugs, maybe cisplatin or carboplatin. They tend to be front-runners for this type of cancer. Oh, and lately, there's been some buzz about immunotherapy as well, but that's usually if specific conditions are met.\n\nI've got to admit, if we had some genetic details in the mix, that could help a lot – like if there are any specific mutations or if there's expression of PD-L1, we'd have clues about whether something like a targeted therapy might work. But without those specifics, it's a bit up in the air how those play into deciding the path forward.\n\nAlright, back to our elderly patient here. Experience tells me older patients can have varied experiences with treatment – some handle chemotherapy well enough, though it's not without risks. Based on everything I've seen, if the patient is in relatively good health, it's reasonable to hope for at least a partial response to treatment with chemo. That's assuming side effects don't throw a wrench in the works.\n\nSo, wrapping all these thoughts together, I'm thinking that for our 87-year-old with SCLC, the most probable scenario would be seeing a partial response or maybe some stabilization if he's placed on a platinum-based regimen. Seems to ring true with what generally happens in similar cases I've read about or heard.
