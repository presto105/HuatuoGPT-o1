    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's start by thinking about what PD-L1 is telling us. So, PD-L1 expression over 50% in tumors is pretty significant, right? That usually means the cancer might respond really well to immunotherapy drugs like those checkpoint inhibitors. I know those are designed to help the immune system attack the cancer more effectively.\n\nThen there's the patient's age. Being 81 could impact how well he tolerates treatment, but I've read that age alone doesn't always mean the patient won't benefit. If his health is otherwise decent, and especially if the markers like PD-L1 are favorable... well, there's a good chance he might do well with the treatment.\n\nNow, let's consider the fact there's no metastasis.

This could mean a better outcome in general, since there's less cancer for the treatment to deal with. \n\nOh, and Sasanlimab—what do I know about that? It's a PD-1 inhibitor, similar to drugs like Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab, which I'm a bit more familiar with. These drugs work by blocking the pathway that lets cancer cells hide from the immune system, basically helping the immune system recognize and destroy the cancer cells more effectively.\n\nPutting all of this together, given the high PD-L1, no signs of spread, and the use of a PD-1 inhibitor, honestly, things are lining up for potentially a positive response to treatment. It seems like the odds are in favor of reducing or even stabilizing the tumor given all these encouraging signs. \n\nAlright, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. High PD-L1 is a strong indicator for success with immunotherapy, check. No metastasis, check.
