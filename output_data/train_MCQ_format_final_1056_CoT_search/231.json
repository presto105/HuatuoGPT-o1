    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this. This patient has a lung adenocarcinoma, and she's being treated with Gefitinib. Hmm, I know Gefitinib is an EGFR inhibitor, which is pretty key here because her tumor has an EGFR mutation — specifically the E19del mutation.

It's got a solid track record for treating non-small cell lung cancer in cases like this one. So, thinking through it all, with this specific mutation being targeted and no metastasis, the treatment response is likely to be pretty positive.\n\nIn this setup, we'd expect to see the tumor slow down in growth, possibly even get smaller.
