Progressive Disease\nCorrect Answer: SD\n</Multiple-choice Question>\n\nYou are an expert in filtering and evaluating multiple-choice questions for advanced reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "\"Pass\" \n\nThe given multiple-choice question requires a detailed understanding of the patient's clinical profile, including cancer histology, genetic mutations, and specific biomarkers such as PD-L1 and TMB, to infer the most likely treatment response. This requires deeper reasoning, rather than a straightforward recall of facts, thus satisfying the Depth of Reasoning criterion. The question has a unique and unambiguous correct answer, option C - Stable Disease (SD), ensuring that it meets the Unambiguous Correct Answer criterion. Lastly, the question can be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking, \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and the treatment regimen provided, what is the expected treatment response?\" This meets the Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility criterion.",

Ensure it is open-ended, meaning no options are provided, but there must be a definitive Ground-True Answer.\n2.
