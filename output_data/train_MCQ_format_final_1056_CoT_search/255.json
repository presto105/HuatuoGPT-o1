    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through step by step. So, the patient has adenocarcinoma, and it's not of the small cell variety. This is known as non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC for short. Got it. And then there's this detail about it being non-squamous cell carcinoma, which fits right into the NSCLC category specifically for the non-squamous type.\n\nNow, I see the PD-L1 expression is between 1% and 49%. PD-L1, that's an important marker. It's kind of like a signpost telling us how well certain immunotherapy treatments might work. From what I know, treatments like Pembrolizumab tend to be more effective if this marker is expressed at higher levels. But having some expression—like this patient does—should still give a decent chance for the treatment to work, just maybe not as strong as if it were above 50%.\n\nAnd speaking of treatment, we're looking at a combination here: Pembrolizumab with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin. These are some heavy hitters! Pembrolizumab is part of the newer wave of immunotherapy, and it works by targeting PD-1 to help the immune system fight cancer more effectively. Pemetrexed and Carboplatin are chemotherapy drugs, and they tend to work by attacking cancer cells directly.\n\nHaving the combination of these treatments seems smart. The chemotherapy can weaken the cancer, and the immunotherapy can give the immune system a boost to finish the job. This duo, or trio rather, is pretty common for non-squamous NSCLC. I've heard it said that patients often have better outcomes with this combo than just having chemotherapy alone.\n\nGiven this mix of treatments and the PD-L1 expression level, I think we're in a decent spot. The clinical studies hint that this patient should respond positively, with some shrinkage of the tumor seems likely. It's kind of like setting up the dominos just right. They might not all fall perfectly, but chances are good that many of them will.\n\nSo, when it all comes together, I feel confident saying that the treatment should help this patient. It seems like with everything aligning—PD-L1 expression, the use of Pembrolizumab, and the chemotherapy—the expected response should be a good one. There's a fair expectation of tumor shrinkage and probably some more time before the cancer progresses further. The outcome won't be as dramatic as cases with higher PD-L1, but it still leans positive.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the patient's clinical profile with adenocarcinoma at stage Non SqCC, exhibiting a PD-L1 expression in the 1~49% range and undergoing a treatment regimen of Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin, what is the most likely response to the treatment?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
