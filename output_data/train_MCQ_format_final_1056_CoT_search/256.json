    "<Internal Thinking>\nFirst things first, let's try to paint a picture of the patient's genetic profile. He's dealing with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, and the genetic tests bring some good insights. He's got a wild type EGFR, a KRAS mutation, and tests show ALK negative. Quite a mix, right? Now, these genetic factors? They really steer the treatment ship — they tell us a lot about what medications may or may not work effectively. \n\nOkay, let's dive a bit deeper into the KRAS mutation here. From what I know, having a KRAS mutation typically means having a poor response to EGFR inhibitors. Hmm, not the most encouraging news, but hey, we're looking for what can work, not what doesn't. I know there are some therapies specifically targeting some KRAS mutations, like KRAS G12C inhibitors. Too bad we don't have that info about the type of KRAS mutation. Anyway, without those mentioned, it's likely not on the table for now.\n\nNow, what about the PD-L1 expression? It's clocking in at 0%. Yikes, that's quite low. Usually, low PD-L1 levels are less likely to dance well with immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab or nivolumab. These work better when PD-L1 is high. So, it's sort of like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole if we push those, I guess. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? Ah, chemotherapy with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. It's a pretty standard play for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer types — adenocarcinoma included. The response rates can be varied though, but with the genetic setup we're seeing here, targeted therapies or immunotherapies just aren't holding up their end of the bargain. \n\nGiven all of this, the chemotherapy combo of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin does seem the most realistic path forward. Like, when all's said and done, some patients respond partially, some stabilize, and hey, that's not nothing, right?\n\nTo wrap this up, for a 72-year-old guy with this specific genetic and PD-L1 profile, the most likely outcome with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin chemo would be a partial response or maybe his disease will stabilize. And that, in the absence of any better options due to his genetic and tumor markers, sounds about right.\n\nYup, that makes sense given everything we've sorted through here. The lack of those actionable mutations and such a low PD-L1 expression point to this being the most probable outcome. Yeah, we're good with this conclusion.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 72-year-old male patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR wild type, KRAS mutation, ALK negative, and PD-L1 expression of 0%, who is receiving Pemetrexed/Cisplatin chemotherapy, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
