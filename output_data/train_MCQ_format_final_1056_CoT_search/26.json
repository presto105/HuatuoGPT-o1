    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, so we have a 68-year-old male patient dealing with adenocarcinoma that's unfortunately spread to the brain. That's already quite complicated.

I mean, 95% is like a jackpot for predicting a good response.\n\nNow, when we throw in KRAS and TP53 mutations, it gets a bit tricky.
