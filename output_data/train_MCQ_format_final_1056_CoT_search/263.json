    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so let's think about this. We've got a 66-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer, and her genetic tests show a specific mutation in the EGFR gene – it's called exon 19 deletion. From what I remember, patients with this mutation often respond really well to a particular group of drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs. Afatinib is a TKI that's known to be particularly good for treating cancers with this EGFR mutation. That's a positive sign already.\n\nNow, let's talk about that tumor mutational burden, or TMB – it's pretty high here, showing 23.9 mutations per megabase. Normally, a high TMB suggests that immunotherapy could be a good option because it means the tumor has a lot of mutations, potentially making it easier for the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer cells. But, there's a twist when it comes to EGFR mutations like this one.\n\nWith the EGFR exon 19 deletion, targeted therapy with Afatinib is usually prioritized over other treatments. That's important because Afatinib is specifically designed to target the overactive EGFR and tends to work really well for these mutations. Most patients with this type of mutation see their tumors either shrink significantly or stop growing altogether when treated with Afatinib. Even though the high TMB suggests immunotherapy could be considered, the presence of the EGFR E19del mutation means Afatinib is likely to be very effective anyway.\n\nGiven these points, I really think the patient is likely to have a positive response to Afatinib. I'm expecting either a notable reduction in tumor size or a stabilization of the disease as a result of this treatment. It all makes sense based on what usually happens in similar cases.\n\nAlright, let's circle back quickly to ensure everything adds up. Afatinib is highly effective against EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. The high TMB hints at other possible treatments, but it doesn't change the effectiveness of Afatinib for this specific mutation. So, yes, a good response to Afatinib is definitely a safe bet here.
