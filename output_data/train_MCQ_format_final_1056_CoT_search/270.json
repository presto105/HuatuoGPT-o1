    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's see what we're dealing with here. We've got a patient with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, right? So, that’s already guiding us toward specific treatments. And they’re EGFR wild type, which means we're not looking at any fancy targeted therapies for EGFR mutations. \n\nOh, and look, the PD-L1 expression is at 0%. That’s significant because it tells us that immunotherapies, which often rely on PD-L1 expression, might not be super effective here. Still, we wouldn’t rule them out entirely just yet. Every bit of information helps paint the full picture. \n\nHmm, brain metastasis is part of the story too. That certainly complicates things a bit. Brain involvement often changes how aggressive we need to be with treatment, since it can indicate advanced disease. But it's interesting: Pemetrexed, part of their regimen with Cisplatin, can get through the blood-brain barrier to some extent. That could be a silver lining because while it isn’t a magic bullet, it means we might get some beneficial action on those brain lesions.\n\nNow, let's not forget their smoking history. Given the previous smoking, we know there’s likely some significant impact on lung health and potential resistance to some therapies, but hey, they’re already on a chemo regimen. Speaking of which, this Pemetrexed/Cisplatin combo is a pretty standard go-to for non-squamous NSCLC without those driver mutations we talked about. \n\nOh, and I almost missed it — their BMI is 19.03. That’s on the lower side, which can hint at less nutritional reserve to withstand the Grueling effects of chemotherapy. This could play into how well they tolerate treatment and how aggressively we can push it.\n\nSo if I piece it all together — the absence of an actionable mutation or PD-L1 expression, the presence of brain metastases, and that specific chemo regimen they’re on — it would be reasonable to expect a modest treatment response.
