    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's figure this out. We have a 60-year-old woman dealing with adenocarcinoma of the lung. It's one of those non-squamous, non-small cell varieties. At this stage, she's needing systemic treatment, something strong enough to tackle her cancer where it's at.\n\nNow, her PD-L1 expression levels caught my eye—3% with the 22C3 assay and 5% with the SP263 assay. That's relatively low, right? Not the best news if we're just talking about Pembrolizumab on its own because it usually likes higher levels to really shine.\n\nBut wait, we're not just throwing Pembrolizumab her way willy-nilly. She's getting it alongside some heavy hitters, Pemetrexed and Carboplatin. That's kind of the standard combo for advanced non-squamous NSCLC these days, and it can work its magic even when PD-L1 is low.\n\nOh, and there's this RET fusion gene situation. This bit is interesting because RET-positive cancers can sometimes do well with specific targeted therapies. But we're not tapping into that yet—we're starting with the broad-spectrum approach.\n\nHer tumor mutation burden is 4.7 mutations per megabase. Not too high, so maybe immunotherapy wouldn't be overwhelmingly effective on its own. A combination therapy might be a good call to kind of balance things out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, her current treatment might offer a reasonable level of disease control. It's a strategy that still could bring some benefit even with lower PD-L1 and TMB scores. But I bet if this doesn’t work as well as hoped, pivoting to RET inhibitors could be a plan.\n\nI think we've got it. The expected response is probably moderate, with disease control being likely. The idea is to keep an eye open for any need to shift strategies if things don't go as planned, especially considering her RET fusion. That makes sense, right?

The presence of a RET fusion gene introduces the possibility of targeted therapy as a subsequent option, especially if the current regimen does not achieve the desired outcome.\n\nOverall, the expectation with this treatment plan is to achieve disease control. It is crucial to regularly assess the patient's response to the current therapy and remain ready to consider alternative treatment strategies, such as RET inhibitors, should the need arise.",
  "Question": "Given the clinical profile of a 60-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma at a non-squamous cell carcinoma stage, who has a PD-L1 expression of 3% (22C3) and 5% (SP263) and is undergoing treatment with Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin, with a tumor mutation burden of 4.7 mutations/Mb and a RET fusion gene, what is the most likely treatment response?"
