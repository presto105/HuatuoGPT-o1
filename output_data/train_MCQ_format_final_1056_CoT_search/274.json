    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this. PD-L1 expression is really important here because it can tell us how likely the patient is to respond to Pembrolizumab, which is an immune checkpoint inhibitor. When we say PD-L1 expression is 85%, that's pretty high. So usually, higher levels of PD-L1 mean the patient might respond better to this kind of immunotherapy. \n\nNow, we've got to look at the treatment combination. So she's being treated with Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin. This combo is quite standard for non-small cell lung cancer, especially when someone's PD-L1 expression is high. I remember reading that using this combination can lead to better outcomes in terms of how long it takes for cancer to come back or how long patients live compared to just using chemotherapy. \n\nBut wait, she's 78 years old. Age could definitely play a role here in terms of how well she can handle the treatment. Older patients might have different side effects, and we need to consider that. However, from what I've read, even for older patients, if that PD-L1 expression is high, like in her case, it usually means she'll still respond well to the treatment. \n\nSo, putting all this together, I think because of her high PD-L1 expression and the use of a robust treatment combo including Pembrolizumab, there's a high chance she'll have a positive response. This could be anything from her cancer shrinking to stabilize completely. Of course, individual reactions can vary, but the odds seem in her favor here. \n\nLastly, just to be sure, I remember checking treatment guidelines and some clinical trials before. They back this up showing that patients with similar profiles often respond well. So yeah, I'm fairly confident in saying that a significant positive response is what we're likely looking at for her.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 78-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma showing PD-L1 expression of 85% in both 22C3 and SP263 assays, treated with a combination of Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin, what is the most likely treatment response outcome?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
