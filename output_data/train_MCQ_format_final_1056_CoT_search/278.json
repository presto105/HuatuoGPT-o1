Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's figure this out. We've got a patient, a 43-year-old woman to be exact, with non-small cell lung cancer, specifically non-SqCC adenocarcinoma. Hmm, she's ALK-positive. I know that when it comes to treating such cancer types, being ALK-positive is a crucial factor. Why? Because these tumors are quite responsive to ALK inhibitors. So, that changes things quite a bit when we're thinking about treatment strategies.\n\nNow, let's look at the PD-L1 expression. It's between 1% and 49%. This is like a moderate level, not the highest. It means there could be some benefit from immunotherapy, but it's not as strong an indicator as it would be if it were 50% or more. Still, in ALK-positive cases like hers, this PD-L1 level might not change the game since ALK inhibitors usually take the front seat.\n\nCurrently, she's on Pemetrexed and Cisplatin chemotherapy. Hmm, that's pretty standard for non-small cell lung cancer. But here’s the kicker: for ALK-positive cases, this standard chemotherapy often isn't the best at delivering strong results compared to ALK inhibitors. ALK inhibitors like crizotinib, alectinib, or brigatinib are usually more effective because they target the specific genetic abnormality driving the cancer.\n\nGiven all this, I'm thinking that the response to her current chemotherapy could be just moderate. It's likely not going to be as effective as ALK-targeted therapy, given her cancer's specific genetic makeup. People with her kind of cancer profile generally see better results when switched to ALK inhibitors.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors — her age, cancer type, genetic markers, and current treatment — it seems clear. The most logical expectation is that while there might be some response to the Pemetrexed/Cisplatin treatment, it wouldn't be as substantial as if she were on an ALK inhibitor. Yeah, that's my take on her situation.
