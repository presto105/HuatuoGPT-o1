Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's figure this out. We've got a patient, a 43-year-old woman to be exact, with non-small cell lung cancer, specifically non-SqCC adenocarcinoma. Hmm, she's ALK-positive. I know that when it comes to treating such cancer types, being ALK-positive is a crucial factor. Why? Because these tumors are quite responsive to ALK inhibitors. So, that changes things quite a bit when we're thinking about treatment strategies.\n\nNow, let's look at the PD-L1 expression. It's between 1% and 49%. This is like a moderate level, not the highest. It means there could be some benefit from immunotherapy, but it's not as strong an indicator as it would be if it were 50% or more.

But hereâ€™s the kicker: for ALK-positive cases, this standard chemotherapy often isn't the best at delivering strong results compared to ALK inhibitors.

It's likely not going to be as effective as ALK-targeted therapy, given her cancer's specific genetic makeup.
