Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The question involves evaluating a cancer patient's potential response to a specific immunotherapy treatment regimen based on a detailed clinical profile, including factors such as PD-L1 expression, mutation status, and tumor mutational burden. Assessing the treatment response requires integration of this complex data, which aligns with the need for deep reasoning. The presence of multiple specific clinical parameters and their interplay suggests nuanced decision-making rather than a straightforward empirical rule, which would meet the depth of reasoning criterion.\n\nThe question specifies \"SD\" (Stable Disease) as the correct answer, indicating that the question anticipates a unique response to the treatment based on the provided patient details. This addresses the requirement for an unambiguous correct answer, as the clinical context given in the scenario supports the adjudged outcome.\n\nOpen-ended reformulation feasibility is met as the question can be rephrased to ask, \"Based on the provided clinical profile of the patient, predict the most likely response to Durvalumab treatment.\" This enables interpretation while still allowing for a clear answer grounded in clinical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation for this question is:\n\n\"Pass\"",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's figure this out. Durvalumab is one of those PD-L1 inhibitors, right?

So, the key here is PD-L1 expression.\n\nNow, looking at our 75-year-old patient, the first thing we should check is his PD-L1 levels. Yeah, that’s because higher PD-L1 means a better hit rate with Durvalumab, as it targets this exact pathway.

With an assumption of adequate PD-L1 expression and considering our patient’s age and cancer type, he’s probably looking at a moderate chance of responding well to the treatment. Of course, we’d want actual PD-L1 data or more genetic info to be sure, but under the assumption game, this thinking seems on point.\n\nAt the end of the day, if his PD-L1 is up there, we’ve got a good shot of seeing Durvalumab make a difference.
