    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so we're dealing with adenosquamous carcinoma—a pretty rare and aggressive type of lung cancer. It's interesting because it has features of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Now, the usual play here is to go with the standard NSCLC treatments, and that includes immunotherapy, which seems promising especially when we’re talking about Pembrolizumab.\n\nNow, PD-L1 expression. This is a buzzword I hear a lot. It's a biomarker that really helps us gauge how well someone might respond to this kind of immunotherapy. High levels usually hint that the immune checkpoint blockade could be quite effective. This patient has high PD-L1 expression, which is a big tick in favor of Pembrolizumab working well.\n\nOh, and there's smoking to think about. This patient's a current smoker, and here’s a wrinkle: smokers often have a higher tumor mutational burden. However, in this case, the TMB is about 5.5 mutations per megabase, which strikes me as low to moderate. TMB is another biomarker that helps predict the responsiveness to immunotherapy. Usually, higher TMB is better, but then again, it’s not the only thing in play.\n\nBut wait, smoking isn’t always just about TMB; smokers sometimes show better responses even if the TMB isn’t off-the-charts high. It could be other mutation stuff going on that we’re not catching with just TMB.\n\nSo, we’ve got a patient with a high PD-L1 and a moderate TMB. The high PD-L1 is already painting a positive picture for how this treatment might pan out. Toss in the current smoking status—well, it adds layers but doesn’t overshadow the PD-L1. Most signs here point to a positive reaction, maybe even some tumor shrinkage or stabilization once the Pembrolizumab does its thing.\n\nAll things considered, I’d wager the treatment response is going to be pretty good. It’s lined up with what we usually see in cases with similar profiles. So, yeah, that high PD-L1’s probably the clincher for a favorable outcome on Pembrolizumab.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the clinical profile of a 75-year-old male with adenosquamous carcinoma, current smoking status, high PD-L1 expression, and a tumor mutational burden of 5.5 mutations/Mb undergoing immunotherapy with Pembrolizumab, what is the most likely treatment response expected?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
