    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, so we're talking about a treatment plan that includes Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin.

Sounds hopeful if the PD-L1 is high and there aren’t those pesky mutations like EGFR or ALK messing things up.\n\nIn the end, yeah, this makes sense with what we've seen in studies, where adding Pembrolizumab to the mix improves outcomes better than just chemotherapy alone.
