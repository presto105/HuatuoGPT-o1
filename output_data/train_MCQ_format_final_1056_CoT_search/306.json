    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through. We’ve got a combination treatment here with Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin. That’s a pretty standard cocktail for non-small cell lung cancer, specifically the non-squamous type. Pembrolizumab is our immune checkpoint inhibitor superstar—it picks on PD-1, a protein that usually helps cancer hide from the immune system.\n\nNow, why do we care about PD-L1 expression? Because it's a big deal in predicting how well Pembrolizumab will work. High levels of PD-L1 expression generally mean the Pembrolizumab can do its job better, as this protein pathway gets blocked, allowing the immune system to attack the cancer.\n\nLet’s talk histology—the kind of non-small cell lung cancer matters. For non-squamous, like adenocarcinoma, using Pemetrexed and Carboplatin makes sense because it’s known to work better here.\n\nWait, there’s another layer—genetic stuff, like mutations. Some mutations, like EGFR or ALK rearrangements, mean Pembrolizumab might not be the star it usually is. In these cases, targeted therapies could be better picks. So, if there are no actionable mutations, Pembrolizumab might be our hero here.\n\nBringing it all together, if we have a patient with non-squamous NSCLC, high PD-L1 expression, and no EGFR or ALK mutations, the treatment should work pretty well. That's because everything is in place for Pembrolizumab to hit its target hard—we’ve got the right cancer type and biological environment.\n\nTo wrap it up, the patient’s profile aligns well with a positive response to this regimen.
