    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through. The patient's got a PD-L1 expression of 0%. That's not great because we know PD-L1 can kind of tell us how well someone might do on immunotherapy—it's like a preview of the immune system's response. Low expression usually means immunotherapy might not work so well by itself.\n\nNow, let's look at the Tumor Mutational Burden, or TMB. It's reported as 4.7 mutations per megabase. Not exactly high. Generally, a higher TMB can be a good sign for immunotherapy responses because more mutations mean more targets for the immune system. At 4.7, it's on the lower side, so again, it suggests less potential for immunotherapy to shine.\n\nBut wait, she's also getting chemotherapy. Sometimes, chemo can enhance how immunotherapy works.
