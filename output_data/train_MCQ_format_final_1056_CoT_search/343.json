    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through. We're dealing with a 76-year-old patient who's been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, and their PD-L1 expression is at a whopping 95%. That's really high! Typically, when PD-L1 is that elevated, it suggests that immune checkpoint inhibitors, like pembrolizumab, might be a great treatment option. These drugs are designed to work really well when PD-L1 expression is up there. \n\nSo, hmm, they are actually using gefitinib for the treatment here. Gefitinib is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and it's usually given to patients when there's a specific EGFR mutation present in their tumor. Yeah, that's because these mutations can predict how well a patient will respond to drugs like gefitinib. But hold on, the information here doesn't mention if there's any known EGFR mutation in this patient. That makes things a bit tricky.\n\nWithout knowing the EGFR status, it feels a bit off to use gefitinib based only on PD-L1 expression. That's usually an indicator for a different type of treatment strategy. High PD-L1 typically nudges us towards immune therapies, not necessarily tyrosine kinase inhibitors like gefitinib. So, considering all these factors, I'd say there's a good chance that the response to gefitinib isn't quite what we'd hope for without additional evidence of an EGFR mutation. Generally, in these scenarios, it's the EGFR mutation status that would drive the decision to use gefitinib, not just the PD-L1 levels.\n\nGiven all of this, it's really looking like gefitinib might not be hitting the mark here unless they find that specific mutation. It seems more in tune to explore other therapeutic options better aligned with that high PD-L1 expression—or at least that's how I'm piecing it together.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the patient's clinical profile, including their 76-year-old age, adenocarcinoma diagnosis with PD-L1 (SP263) expression at 95%, and treatment with gefitinib, what is the most likely response to treatment?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
