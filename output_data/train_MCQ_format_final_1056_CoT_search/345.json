    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's start by thinking about the treatment the patient is on. She's getting Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin. That's quite a powerful combination, isn't it? Pembrolizumab, I've read somewhere, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor. It's supposed to really boost the immune system, helping it to target and fight the cancer more effectively. Pretty impressive how it works, right?\n\nThen there's Pemetrexed. It's a chemotherapy drug that interferes with cell division. Basically, it makes it harder for cells to split and grow, especially those cancer cells. And Carboplatin, that's another one of those chemotherapy agents. It's platinum-based, which means it damages the DNA of the cancer cells.\n\nNow, thinking about how these work together, combining an immune booster like Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy often ramps up the effectiveness. It's a common approach for cancers like non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer when it’s advanced. Together, they seem to tackle the cancer from different angles, which usually gives a better chance of a positive response compared to just using chemotherapy alone.\n\nBut let's also consider the patient. She's 86 years old. Age can affect how someone responds to and can tolerate treatment. Still, from what I recall, Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy can be quite effective for elderly patients too, as long as they can handle it physically.\n\nWhat are the possible outcomes we could expect? Well, she might respond really well, and her tumor could shrink. Or the disease might stabilize, meaning it doesn't get worse. Of course, there's always a chance that the cancer doesn't respond and keeps progressing, but with this treatment plan, a positive outcome like tumor shrinkage or stabilization is quite possible.\n\nAll things considered, this combination therapy she’s on generally tends to lead to better outcomes. So, I’d say the likelihood of a good response is pretty high. She might see some tumor reduction or at least hold the disease in check for a while.\n\nYeah, with this information, concluding that she'll likely experience a favorable response feels about right.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the provided clinical profile of an 86-year-old female patient with non-squamous non-small cell carcinoma and current treatment regimen including Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
