    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's start by thinking about this EGFR mutation the patient has. It's this L861Q mutation, and although it's not one of the most common ones like the exon 19 deletions or L858R that I hear about a lot, it's still considered a sensitizing mutation. This means it should respond to those EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, we use in treating non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nAfatinib is the drug she's been given. It’s a second-generation EGFR TKI. I've read that it binds irreversibly, so it’s like a more permanent blockade for the cancer's growth signals. That's kinda cool, right? For mutations like L861Q, which are less common, Afatinib can still be effective. I’m expecting it to lead to maybe a partial response where the cancer shrinks, or at least it stabilizes so it doesn’t get worse.\n\nNow, about this PD-L1 expression—or in this case, the lack of it. From what I know, PD-L1 status is more critical when we're considering immunotherapies, like checkpoint inhibitors. Since she's on a targeted therapy like Afatinib, I don't think the PD-L1 expression is going to mess things up here. So, probably no need to worry about that aspect in this context.\n\nThinking about the overall outcome, patients with EGFR mutations typically respond well to these EGFR TKIs. So, given she has this mutation and she's on Afatinib, you would think there’s a good chance for a positive outcome. Since L861Q is known to be a sensitizing mutation, it’s reasonable to expect her cancer might at least shrink a bit or stay stable without growing.\n\nOkay, to wrap this up, all things considered, the most realistic expectation for her response to the treatment would be seeing her cancer shrink somewhat or not grow any further. That's the beauty of having a sensitizing mutation like L861Q and being on a drug like Afatinib. It matches what I've read and makes sense with what we know about the drug’s action.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 64-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma, possessing an EGFR L861Q mutation and no PD-L1 expression, who is undergoing targeted therapy with Afatinib, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>. The response style should resemble GPT-4's style as much as possible. Output only your final response, without any additional content."

    "The most likely treatment response for a 64-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR L861Q mutation and no PD-L1 expression, who is receiving Afatinib, is a positive clinical outcome. Afatinib, a second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is known to be particularly effective against EGFR-sensitizing mutations such as L861Q. Although less common than mutations like exon 19 deletions or L858R, the L861Q mutation still predicts a favorable response to EGFR TKIs. Therefore, the expected treatment response would likely be a reduction in tumor size (partial response) or disease stabilization (where the cancer does not progress). The lack of PD-L1 expression is more pertinent to the use of immunotherapy, and it should not negatively impact the efficacy of Afatinib, which specifically targets the mutated EGFR pathway."
