    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's pull this together. We have an 87-year-old woman who's dealing with some tough stuff — a non-squamous cell carcinoma, specifically adenocarcinoma. It's also turned problematic because it's spread to her brain, but hey, at least it's not in the liver. That's something, right?\n\nNow, her BMI is 26.03, which tips her over into the overweight category. Age and weight can sometimes play a role in how the body handles cancer and treatment, but thankfully, she's never smoked, so we can cross out smoking-related issues from her list of challenges.\n\nLet's dive into the molecular details. Her cancer cells don't have mutations in the EGFR gene; they're wild-type. This means some of those fancy targeted EGFR inhibitor therapies we hear about aren’t really going to work for her. And on top of that, her cancer shows 0% PD-L1 expression. You know, PD-L1 is one of those markers that doctors look at to see if certain drugs, like Pembrolizumab, might work better. But with 0%, it usually means the immune therapy response might not be as strong.\n\nBut wait, let's talk treatment. She's on Pembrolizumab plus a couple of chemotherapy drugs: Pemetrexed and Carboplatin. Normally, we'd think Pembrolizumab works best with higher PD-L1 levels, but combining it with chemo can sometimes give it a boost. Chemo can be pretty effective across the board; it doesn't need that PD-L1 expression to have an impact, which is great.\n\nSo, what might we expect from all of this? It's a tough call, especially with brain involvement and the fact her PD-L1 is so low. A complete response might be too much to hope for here, given all these factors. But it's not all bleak — she's got a good chance of seeing her disease stabilize or even shrink a bit, thanks to the combination of these treatments. Partial response or stable disease is quite likely, all things considered.\n\nYeah, with the brain metastasis and the 0% PD-L1 in mind, this is generally how these things play out. So, it feels like my conclusion about the partial response or stable disease probably fits well with what we'd expect in these circumstances.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nConsidering an 87-year-old female patient with a BMI of 26.03, never a smoker, diagnosed with non-squamous cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma) with brain metastasis but no liver metastasis, wild-type EGFR status, 0% PD-L1 expression, and a treatment regimen of Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>. The response style should resemble GPT-4's style as much as possible. Output only your final response, without any additional content."
