    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's see what we're dealing with here. The patient has a couple of EGFR mutations, L858R and T790M. Now, L858R is one of those mutations that usually play nice with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. So, meds like erlotinib or gefitinib would generally be a good match. But, here's the twist: T790M tends to throw a wrench in that plan. It's the kind of mutation that makes the cancer cells resistant to those first-generation inhibitors. \n\nOh, that reminds me, third-generation inhibitors like osimertinib are designed to combat this sort of resistance. They're like the specialists in dealing with the T790M mutation. Seems like they hit the mark when others can't. \n\nNow, what's going on with PD-L1 expression? Hmm, the patient doesn't have any significant PD-L1 expression. That usually means those fancy new immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab might not be the shining stars here unless there's something else going on to tip the scale in their favor. \n\nSo, she's currently on Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. That combo has a solid reputation for treating non-squamous NSCLC, but hey, it doesn't specifically target that pesky T790M mutation. It’s more of a general attack strategy rather than a sharpshooter approach. \n\nThe brain metastasis – yeah, that's another critical point to consider. Some treatments can't really cross into the brain effectively, but osimertinib actually can. That could be a game-changer because brain metastases are tricky business.\n\nSo, putting all this together, I’d say sticking solely with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin might not be the optimal plan of attack here given the T790M mutation and the brain metastasis. Osimertinib might just be the ticket as it’s known for handling these situations quite well. Let's also remember there's substantial backing from current evidence in its favor for precisely this scenario. It’s like they've tailored it for cases just like this.
