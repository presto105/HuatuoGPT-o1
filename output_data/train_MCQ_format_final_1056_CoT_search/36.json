    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about what's going on here. So, we've got a patient with non-small cell lung cancer, and we're specifically dealing with that common EGFR E19del mutation. I remember reading that this particular mutation is often quite responsive to treatments known as EGFR TKIs. These are medications that target specific cancer cell growth mechanisms—pretty neat stuff, actually. \n\nNow, they're treating this patient initially with Afatinib. Alright, Afatinib is a second-generation drug in this class, so it's a bit more advanced and wider-reaching in how it tackles these mutations compared to the earlier drugs. It's generally known to work well against the E19del mutation. So, it's pretty fair to expect a good, positive response initially when they're on Afatinib. \n\nBut then, there's this switch to Gefitinib, which is a bit different because it's a first-generation TKI. This treatment shift can be strategic but there's a catch. Gefitinib may not handle secondary resistance the same way Afatinib can. There's this one pesky mutation called T790M that can pop up and cause problems, making the cancer resist treatment. If the patient doesn't develop this mutation, then maybe Gefitinib could still be a viable option, keeping things under control. \n\nAll of this boils down to the idea that the patient should feel quite a bit of relief on Afatinib, at least at first. If things change after they switch to Gefitinib, it might be worth checking if resistance mutations like T790M have developed. If not, and there's still a decent response, it might be going well. But, you'd really want to keep an eye out for anything unusual just in case. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the initial stage with Afatinib should look pretty promising, while the transition to Gefitinib might need careful monitoring to ensure continued efficacy.
