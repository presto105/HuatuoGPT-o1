    "<Internal Thinking>\nLet's see, the patient has an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation. I know these mutations can be tricky since they don't respond well to the usual first-gen EGFR inhibitors like erlotinib or gefitinib. That's unfortunate because those inhibitors are a go-to for other EGFR mutations, but not here. This must mean a tougher prognosis, generally speaking. \n\nNow, considering the chemotherapy regimen, Pemetrexed and Cisplatin is a common combination for NSCLC. Many patients with adenocarcinoma receive this, especially if their cancer isn't squamous. Pemetrexed tends to do well for non-squamous cases, and Cisplatin—well, it's one of those classic heavy hitters in the chemo arsenal. The problem, though, is this specific mutation and the brain metastases. \n\nAh, the brain metastases, that's a rough situation. If only the chemo could get through that blood-brain barrier more effectively. There are treatments that penetrate the CNS better than these standard options. I can see that brain metastases really add another layer of complexity. From what I remember, chemo often struggles a bit more in controlling cancer that's spread to the brain. \n\nHmm, let's think about alternatives here. For EGFR exon 20 insertions, newer therapies like mobocertinib and amivantamab have shown promise. I think their ability to possibly work where others don't, maybe even in the brain, could really make a difference for the patient. These treatments were developed with these tricky mutations in mind, so surely there's more potential here than with regular chemo. \n\nSo putting it all together, I'd say with this patient's profile—age, mutation type, brain involvement, and the current chemo—he's likely to have a limited response. The mutation reduces how effective the chemo can be, and the brain metastases just double down on that challenge. Best to discuss those newer options with the care team, considering how targeted treatments could change the game here.\n\nI should confirm what I know about EGFR E20ins. Yes, everything I've seen in studies and guidelines echoes that chemo isn't usually the best against this kind of mutation. The newer treatments are just better tailored.
