    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's see what we have here. We've got a 68-year-old lady dealing with non-small cell lung carcinoma.

That's something significant because it's often linked to how well the treatment can work, especially this Pembrolizumab.\n\nNow, about Pembrolizumab – I remember it being used quite a bit as a first-line treatment, particularly when PD-L1 levels are high like in her case. So, there's a good chance that this can be effective.

High PD-L1 expression is associated with a better response to Pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in cases where the expression is greater than 50%, as in this patient.
