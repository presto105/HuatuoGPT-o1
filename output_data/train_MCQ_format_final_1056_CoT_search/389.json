So, this patient has non-small cell lung cancer, and we know that PD-L1 expression can influence how well certain treatments work. Hmm, he's got PD-L1 expression between 1% and 49%. That's interesting because Pembrolizumab works well for patients with PD-L1 levels starting from 1% and up.\n\nNow, let's see. We’re looking at a combination treatment here: Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Cisplatin. These are pretty standard for treating NSCLC, especially when there aren't any of those actionable mutations like EGFR, ALK, or ROS1. Good, we can check those mutations off the list — they're negative here.\n\nAlright, back to our medicine mix. Pemetrexed and Cisplatin are used a lot for lung adenocarcinoma. They help knock down the tumor load and, from what my brain tells me, they work quite well when combined with immunotherapy, like Pembrolizumab, for patients with a bit of PD-L1 expression. This combo really helps in controlling the disease and might give us longer survival rates.\n\nOh, wait a minute, we can't forget the brain metastasis here. That's a tricky factor, but Pembrolizumab has shown it can do some work on brain lesions, and the chemotherapy should help with the overall cancer control. No EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 mutations, which means we’re on the right path with this treatment plan.\n\nHmm, thinking this through, what's the likely outcome from all of this? With the current treatment combo and the given PD-L1 level, I'd bet we're looking at either a partial response or at least some stabilization of the disease. Most patients with similar profiles generally respond positively.\n\nYeah, this makes sense. The use of Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy is expected to give better results than chemo alone, considering the PD-L1-expression.
