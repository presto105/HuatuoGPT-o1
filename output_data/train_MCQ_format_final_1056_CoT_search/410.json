    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's see what we have here. We have a 77-year-old gentleman. He's got a BMI of 20.22, so he's on the leaner side. Okay, now he's dealing with adenocarcinoma. It's non-squamous, and the good news is there are no liver or brain metastases. That's something pretty important because it can influence how we approach treatment.\n\nNow, let's talk about the genes. This cancer is wild-type for EGFR, which means those specific mutations aren't there. And he's negative for ALK and ROS1 too. So, those fancy targeted therapies, like the kinase inhibitors for EGFR or ALK/ROS1, aren't going to be our go-to options.\n\nWhat about PD-L1? Well, he's got a PD-L1 expression of 0%. That's quite low, which means the cancer might not respond as well if we only used PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. But, hold on, he's receiving a combo of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Even if PD-L1 is low, using both chemo and immunotherapy together could still be beneficial. They could work in tandem, boosting the immune response and possibly controlling the disease better.\n\nSo, what might we expect treatment-wise? The chemotherapy has those direct cytotoxic effects, right? And when you combine it with immunotherapy, there could be some enhancement in their effectiveness, even if the PD-L1 expression is not high. That's the synergy we're hoping for.\n\nOverall, given the whole picture here, the combination treatment might help in controlling the disease, maybe even slowing its progression. But let's be realistic—the complete response or a really long progression-free survival might not be on the cards. After all, there are no driver mutations and the PD-L1 is low.\n\nTaking a step back, this whole setup makes sense. When I look at similar cases, it's typical to see some level of disease management from this approach, even if it's not a home run. Yeah, I guess this is a reasonable outlook given everything we're seeing.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven a 77-year-old male patient with a BMI of 20.22 and a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma at non-squamous stage without liver or brain metastasis.
