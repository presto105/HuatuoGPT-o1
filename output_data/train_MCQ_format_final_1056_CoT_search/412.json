    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, so here's what I've got. The patient we're talking about is 81, so age is definitely a factor here. Cancer tends to be more aggressive and harder to treat in older patients. She's got advanced adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the brain, which is already pretty serious.\n\nNow, let me consider the genetic profile. We've got wild-type EGFR and both ALK and ROS1 are negative. That rules out some targeted therapies right there, like EGFR inhibitors or ALK inhibitors, which can be really effective in some cases. So, we're left without those targeted options.\n\nWith PD-L1 expression at 0%, immunotherapy becomes tricky. PD-L1 is like a ticket into using those powerful checkpoint inhibitors, and with 0%, it's telling us that those immunotherapy drugs probably won't do much here. But there's also this thing called tumor mutational burden or TMB – 15.7 mutations per megabase. That's relatively high, and generally, a high TMB might suggest immunotherapy could work. But wait, without PD-L1 expression, it's still not a sure bet.\n\nHmm, so let's move on to the treatment being given: Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. This combo is standard for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, especially when there is no specific mutation to attack with targeted therapy. It's a solid regimen, but it's all about managing disease rather than looking for a groundbreaking response.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'd say the response we're likely to see might be moderate disease control. At her age, and with the existing brain metastasis, the goal often shifts to maintaining quality of life and maybe controlling the tumor's growth rather than outright shrinking it.\n\nLet's think again about that TMB. A higher number is intriguing and would usually push us towards immunotherapies, yet, that pesky 0% PD-L1 really complicates things. It's like a big 'no entry' sign to using them effectively, despite the high TMB kind of nudging us in that direction.\n\nIn summary, it's a challenging situation. The Pemetrexed and Cisplatin might help stabilize things for a bit, but I'm not expecting any dramatic changes here due to the advanced stage and the lack of targeted options. It's about disease management more than anything else at this point.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of an 81-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma, brain metastasis, wild-type EGFR status, negative ALK, and ROS1 statuses, PD-L1 expression of 0%, and a treatment regimen of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin with a tumor mutational burden of 15.7 mutations/Mb, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.

Cancer tends to be more aggressive and harder to treat in older patients. She's got advanced adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the brain, which is already pretty serious.\\n\\nNow, let me consider the genetic profile.

So, we're left without those targeted options.\\n\\nWith PD-L1 expression at 0%, immunotherapy becomes tricky. PD-L1 is like a ticket into using those powerful checkpoint inhibitors, and with 0%, it's telling us that those immunotherapy drugs probably won't do much here. But there's also this thing called tumor mutational burden or TMB – 15.7 mutations per megabase. That's relatively high, and generally, a high TMB might suggest immunotherapy could work. But wait, without PD-L1 expression, it's still not a sure bet.\\n\\nHmm, so let's move on to the treatment being given: Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. This combo is standard for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, especially when there is no specific mutation to attack with targeted therapy. It's a solid regimen, but it's all about managing disease rather than looking for a groundbreaking response.\\n\\nConsidering all these factors, I'd say the response we're likely to see might be moderate disease control. At her age, and with the existing brain metastasis, the goal often shifts to maintaining quality of life and maybe controlling the tumor's growth rather than outright shrinking it.\\n\\nLet's think again about that TMB. A higher number is intriguing and would usually push us towards immunotherapies, yet, that pesky 0% PD-L1 really complicates things. It's like a big 'no entry' sign to using them effectively, despite the high TMB kind of nudging us in that direction.\\n\\nIn summary, it's a challenging situation.

    "Given the clinical profile, the most likely treatment response for the patient is moderate disease control. The combination of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin is a standard and effective choice for treating non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in cases where targeted therapies are not an option. The challenges here include the advanced stage of cancer and brain metastasis, along with the lack of PD-L1 expression, which limits the potential effectiveness of immunotherapy despite the relatively high tumor mutational burden (TMB).\n\nThe goal of treatment at this stage, particularly for an elderly patient, typically focuses on disease stabilization and quality of life management rather than achieving significant tumor shrinkage. The possibility of using immunotherapy is reduced due to the 0% PD-L1 expression, despite the high TMB suggesting some potential benefit. Overall, the treatment is likely to result in stable disease, aiming to control tumor growth and manage symptoms effectively."
