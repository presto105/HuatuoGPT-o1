Now, since we're talking about PD-L1, Pembrolizumab is the drug that comes to mind because it's all about targeting PD-L1.\n\nNow, with his moderate PD-L1 levels, there's a decent chance he'll respond to Pembrolizumab.

Usually, they worry about older patients being able to handle the chemo, but it looks like they've already considered this by choosing a regimen that includes an immune checkpoint inhibitor like Pembrolizumab with the chemo. That's smart because it gives a balanced punch â€“ maybe not as aggressive as other treatments, but it's still quite effective. \n\nConsidering all this, I think there's a good chance he'll have at least a partial response to the treatment. At 10% PD-L1, he should show some kind of reaction, and when you throw in the chemo, that could really help shrink the tumor or at least keep it in check. \n\nAlso, guidelines and what I've read about similar cases suggest that combining Pembrolizumab with chemo gives a better shot at controlling the cancer effectively. Even if it's not a full response, stabilizing the disease is a win.\n\nYeah, overall, I'd say he has a solid chance of getting some positive response from this therapy mix, likely a partial one or maybe just slowing down the disease.
