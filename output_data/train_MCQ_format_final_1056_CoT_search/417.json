Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so I've got a 68-year-old male patient here who has adenocarcinoma. Let's see what we're dealing with. The good news is he doesn't have any liver or brain metastases, which usually makes things a bit easier. Hmm, no spread to those areas could mean a more contained cancer, which is better for him.\n\nNow, let's talk about these biomarkers. He's EGFR wild type and both ALK and ROS1 negative. So what does that tell us? Well, we can't use those fancy targeted therapies that work for patients who have mutations there. Those options are off the table.\n\nThen there's this PD-L1 expression, which is sitting at 0%. Oh man, that's really on the low side. Usually, treatments like atezolizumab, which is a PD-L1 inhibitor, work better when there's more PD-L1 expression. Hmm, with a PD-L1 of 0%, chances are slim that he'll have a robust response to this particular drug.\n\nSo what's likely to happen with the treatment? From what I remember, patients with little to no PD-L1 expression tend to see less tumor shrinkage with PD-L1 inhibitors. Most likely, this man's cancer won't shrink dramatically. Instead, the treatment might just keep things from getting worse for a while.\n\nI guess that means we're probably looking at disease stability rather than big improvements. It's not ideal, but stability can still be a good outcome here. Hmm, when I think about it more, this all lines up with cases I've seen before—where low PD-L1 expression often means a less spectacular response to treatment.
