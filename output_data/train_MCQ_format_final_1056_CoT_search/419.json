    "<Internal Thinking>\nLet's see. We have a 72-year-old man diagnosed with non-squamous cell adenocarcinoma of the lung. That's important because treatment options can vary between squamous and non-squamous types.\n\nHmm, his tumor expresses PD-L1 at a high level, 80% to be precise. PD-L1 expression is a pretty big deal because when it's high, patients often respond better to immune checkpoint inhibitors. These are those drugs that help the immune system see and attack cancer cells. But wait, he's currently being treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin, a chemotherapy combo, rather than an immunotherapy agent.\n\nNow let's think about the EGFR E20ins mutation he has. It's an exon 20 insertion in the EGFR gene, which complicates things. Usually, EGFR mutations mean TKIs could work, but this particular mutation is notorious for being tricky. Many first-line TKIs, like erlotinib or gefitinib, don't work well with E20ins. However, newer treatments like amivantamab and mobocertinib have shown promise specifically against this mutation.\n\nSo, on one hand, we've got high PD-L1, suggesting immune therapies could be beneficial. On the other hand, the current pemetrexed/cisplatin chemo might not be the best option, given that EGFR E20ins mutations can make tumors less responsive to certain treatments. These newer TKIs could be more promising for the mutation he has.\n\nOkay, putting it all together: He's on chemo, but the specific mutation might dampen the response. The high PD-L1 doesn't directly improve chemotherapy outcomes either. With this mutation, there's a chance his response might not be as good as they'd hope for without using targeted therapies.\n\nSo, if we consider the whole picture, it's likely he'll have a moderate response, maybe some disease stabilization or partial response. Even though the high PD-L1 expression is there, it's not being targeted with his current treatment approach. Given the mutation's resistance characteristics, it seems like a complex situation. Yup, we might not see a full response but a sort of stabilization instead.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the given clinical profile of a 72-year-old male patient with non-squamous cell adenocarcinoma, PD-L1 expression of 80%, receiving chemotherapy with a pemetrexed/cisplatin regimen, and having an EGFR E20ins mutation, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
