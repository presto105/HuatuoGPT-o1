    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 85-year-old woman with adenocarcinoma. She's starting pembrolizumab treatment. First off, her PD-L1 expression is at 80%, which seems pretty high. From what I know, tumors with high PD-L1 levels often respond better to this type of therapy.\n\nNow, let's consider her Tumor Mutational Burden, which is at 3.1 mutations per megabase. That's actually on the low side. Usually, when there are more mutations, the immune system has more targets to attack with these therapies, so fewer mutations might mean a weaker response. I should keep this in mind.\n\nThen there’s the fact that she doesn’t have any liver or brain metastasis. That’s definitely good news, at least in terms of overall prognosis. These metastases can make the situation more complicated, so not having them could mean a less aggressive form of cancer. But I’m not entirely sure how much this affects how well pembrolizumab works specifically.\n\nOh, and she’s 85. While age doesn’t directly change how pembrolizumab works, it does make me wonder about her overall ability to handle the treatment. Older patients sometimes have different tolerances, but I’ll focus on the expected response first.\n\nSo, just by looking at the PD-L1 expression, it seems like she might respond pretty well to the treatment, but then again, that low TMB is a bit of a letdown. It suggests she might not get as strong a response as someone with a higher TMB would. It’s like a tug of war between these factors.\n\nOverall, I expect that she will show some level of response thanks to the high PD-L1 expression. However, I can't shake the feeling that the low TMB might make this response less robust than it could be otherwise. Balancing these things, it looks like there’ll be a response, but perhaps not as dramatic as we might hope.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of an 85-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma, a PD-L1 expression of 80%, receiving pembrolizumab treatment with no liver or brain metastasis, and a TMB of 3.1 mutations/Mb, what is the most likely treatment response observed?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
