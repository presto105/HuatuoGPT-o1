    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think this through. Tumor Mutational Burden, or TMB as it's called, measures how many mutations there are in a megabase of a tumor's DNA. So, if a tumor has a TMB of 10.3 mutations per megabase, that's what we might call a moderate level. This number, while not extremely high, could still mean the tumor might respond well to immunotherapy. Why? Because more mutations can sometimes lead to more neoantigens being produced, and neoantigens can help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.\n\nNow, let's consider the fact that there are no liver or brain metastases here. That's often a good sign, right? It suggests the cancer hasn't moved to these critical areas, which generally indicates the disease isn't as aggressive. This could potentially mean a better response to treatment, especially for immunotherapy, which tends to work better in less advanced disease stages.\n\nLet's talk about the immunotherapy regimen, ABL501. This is an investigational drug, so we're still learning about it. The idea behind such treatments is to stimulate the immune system to fight the cancer more effectively. And when you think about it, a moderate TMB could make the immune system more likely to recognize and attack the tumor, especially if ABL501 enhances immune response in some way.\n\nAlright, so putting these pieces together, the moderate TMB combined with no metastasis to the brain or liver suggests a good possibility of a positive response to ABL501.
