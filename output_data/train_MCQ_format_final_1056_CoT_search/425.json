    "<Internal Thinking>\nSo, we've got this mutation in the EGFR gene, specifically S768I. It's not the most common mutation out there, like those well-known ones in exon 19 or the L858R, but it's definitely on our radar.\n\nNow, let's think about treatment options, particularly Afatinib. It's a second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has been highlighted for its power against certain rare EGFR mutations, including S768I. What makes it special is that it binds irreversibly and inhibits the activity of the EGFR and its family members. This means it might even work when first-generation inhibitors falter.\n\nAlright, if we dive into the clinical response, this is where it gets hopeful.

Of course, we all know that individual responses can vary, but the chances look decent.\n\nOh, but wait, let's not forget about some of the complexities.
