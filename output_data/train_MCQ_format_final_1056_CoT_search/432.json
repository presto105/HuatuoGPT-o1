    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so we have a 58-year-old man here with advanced adenocarcinoma, which I know is a type of non-small cell lung cancer, right?

It’s one of those immune checkpoint inhibitors, and it seems to work particularly well when PD-L1 is high. Now, wait, we’re also using Pemetrexed and Carboplatin alongside it, aren't we? They’re like the backbone of chemotherapy approaches for non-squamous NSCLC, and I remember them being used to boost each other's effectiveness when together with immunotherapy.\n\nSo, I'm thinking that the general outcome for people like this guy, with advanced NSCLC and high PD-L1 levels, tends to be pretty positive when they’re treated with this combo.

That’s reassuring.\n\nNow, considering he's 58, well, that's not too old, and with this type of adenocarcinoma, it sounds like this treatment fits him quite well. Plus, high PD-L1—if my memory serves me right—often means better results with Pembrolizumab. Hmm, it wouldn’t be surprising to see a nice reduction in tumor size and maybe an extended period before the cancer starts to progress again.\n\nOh, let's not forget the real-world data and recent studies I’ve seen—they’re in line with expecting a favorable outcome. Feel pretty confident in saying he’s likely to respond well to this regimen.
