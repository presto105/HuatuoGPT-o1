Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "**Pass**\n\nThe question involves examining detailed clinical data and understanding multiple factors that could influence the treatment response for a specific cancer profile. It requires deeper reasoning to assess the impact of various biomarkers, treatment type, and genetic mutations on the likely response to chemotherapy.\n\nThe answer provided is unique and unambiguous, as \"Stable Disease\" (SD) is indicated to be the correct response according to the provided information.\n\nThe scenario can be reformulated into an open-ended question by asking, \"Based on the given patient clinical profile, what is the most likely response to the pemetrexed/carboplatin treatment regimen?\" This allows for an analysis of the clinical details to arrive at the expected treatment outcome.\n\nTherefore, the question meets all the evaluation criteria.",

With a response rate hanging around 20-30% for people like her without those markers, it's mainly about holding the disease where it is.\n\nUltimately, given everything discussed, disease stabilization just seems to fit her profile best.
