    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this a bit. Osimertinib is one of those therapies that's really specific, right? It's an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, so it goes after those EGFR mutations. We often see these mutations in non-small cell lung cancer, particularly in adenocarcinomas. This patient's profile mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a pretty common type.\n\nNow, what we really need here is to dig into her molecular profile. Has she been tested for those specific mutations like exon 19 deletions or the L858R substitution in exon 21? Those are the usual suspects when it comes to EGFR mutations linked with osimertinib.\n\nIf she does have those mutations, oh man, this could be really good. Osimertinib tends to be pretty effective when the mutations match. From what I've heard and read, patients with these mutations generally see a reduction in tumor size and enjoy a longer period before the cancer starts progressing again. It really helps with overall survival as well.\n\nAlso, let’s not forget she's 72, which is important because you want a treatment that's not only effective but also tolerable for older adults. Osimertinib generally has a decent side effect profile compared to traditional chemotherapy or the earlier generations of EGFR inhibitors.\n\nIn conclusion, if those specific EGFR mutations are present, I would expect the treatment with osimertinib to be quite favorable for her. It could lead to significant tumor shrinkage and a better quality of life. But of course, confirming those mutations is key, because the drug won't be as effective without them. So, it seems promising, but we absolutely need to verify those molecular details.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven a 72-year-old female patient with a clinical profile characterized by a non-squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma histology, and specific molecular alterations, what is the expected treatment response to osimertinib targeted therapy?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
