    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about what's going on here. We're dealing with a case of non-small cell lung cancer and the patient is ALK positive. Hmm, ALK positivity means that there's this genetic rearrangement creating a fusion protein. This fusion protein is like fuel for cancer cell growth, so that's a pretty important characteristic to consider.\n\nNow, we've got Alectinib in the mix as the treatment. Alectinib, hmm, that's a targeted therapy specifically aimed at inhibiting ALK. It's designed to latch onto that altered protein and stop it from working. So, this drug is really going directly after what's driving the cancer cells in this patient.\n\nLet's think about what we'd expect to see with this setup.
