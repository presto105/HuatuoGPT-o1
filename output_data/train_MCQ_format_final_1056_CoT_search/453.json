Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation of the multiple-choice question given is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires analyzing multiple aspects of the patient's clinical profile, including cancer type, various genetic mutations, and the treatment regimen. This suggests a depth of reasoning, as one needs to consider how these factors influence treatment response, thus it does not appear \"Too Simple\".\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a clear correct answer option (\"SD\" for Stable Disease) and does not suggest multiple correct answers, making it unambiguous.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could be reformulated into an open-ended format, such as: \"Based on the patient's clinical profile and treatment details, what is the most likely treatment response?\" The reformulated question can still clearly lead to the ground-truth answer of \"Stable Disease\".\n\nGiven these considerations, the evaluation for the question is \"Pass\".",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's dive into understanding what's going on with this 66-year-old gentleman who's dealing with non-squamous cell lung cancer.

It's quite high at 60%, and from what we know, that usually suggests that therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, like Pembrolizumab, are going to be effective.\n\nOh, let's not forget the treatment regimen. He's currently receiving Pembrolizumab, which is that anti-PD-1 therapy, along with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin.

From what we understand, intermediate TMB can mean there’s some degree of responsiveness to immunotherapy.\n\nNow, let's take a look at metastasis. He doesn't have any liver or brain metastases. That absence is typically a good sign because those metastases can complicate outcomes. Also, in terms of overall prognosis, not having metastasis in these critical organs usually indicates a better prognosis.\n\nSo, mulling over all this, what can we reasonably expect from his treatment?
