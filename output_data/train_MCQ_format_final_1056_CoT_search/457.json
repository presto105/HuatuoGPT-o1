    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let me think about this. We have a 72-year-old woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma, which has unfortunately spread to her liver and brain. That's pretty serious. I should consider the genetic aspects here first. Her cancer is EGFR wild type, which means that it doesn't have those mutations in the EGFR gene that some lung cancers have. Those mutations, when present, usually allow for the use of specific targeted therapies that inhibit EGFR. So, in this case, drugs like gefitinib or erlotinib, which are EGFR inhibitors, aren't going to work here.\n\nNow, there's also this CDK4 gain. That's interesting. CDK4 is a part of the cell cycle machinery, and when it's gained, it can lead to more aggressive cancer cell division. There are drugs called CDK inhibitors that can target this, but it looks like her current treatment doesn't include any of them. So, we're not using that strategy right now.\n\nHer treatment includes Pemetrexed and Cisplatin, which is a pretty standard combination. These drugs are often employed in lung cancer and other types of cancer when there aren't specific targetable mutations. Pemetrexed works by interfering with the folate-dependent processes in cell replication, and Cisplatin forms DNA crosslinks that prevent cell division. Basically, they work together to slow down or stop the cancer from growing.\n\nBut what's the response going to be? That’s the big question. For metastatic adenocarcinoma at this stage, the aim is often to reduce symptoms and slow down the disease progression. Patients without targetable mutations usually have a harder time achieving a complete response, especially with metastases in critical areas like the liver and brain.\n\nMost of the time, with the kind of drugs she's getting, we see either a partial response, where the tumors shrink but don't disappear, or stabilization of the disease, where the cancer stops growing for a while. A complete response, where the cancer could completely disappear from scans and tests, is less common in such advanced cases.\n\nSo, considering all of this, I'd say the most likely outcome for her is that the treatment will lead to a partial response or maybe stabilize the disease. That means her cancer won't advance as rapidly, or the tumors might shrink a bit. It's aligned with what we generally expect with this treatment regimen and her genetic markers. Yeah, a partial response or stable disease seems like the most probable scenario.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 72-year-old female patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma that has spread to the liver and brain, with specific genetic alterations including EGFR wild type and CDK4 gain, and undergoing Pemetrexed/Cisplatin chemotherapy, what is the most likely observed treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
