    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, so let's start with the basics. PD-L1 is this protein that some cancer cells, including those in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), have on their surfaces. This protein helps them hide from the immune system. Now, pembrolizumab comes into play as a checkpoint inhibitor. What it does is block the PD-1 receptors on T-cells from interacting with PD-L1, kind of unlocking the immune system so it can recognize and attack the cancer cells. \n\nNow, about the PD-L1 levels, a quick fact: when PD-L1 expression is high, like 50% or more, patients generally respond better to pembrolizumab. Our patient’s expression level isn’t just high, it’s at 95%. That’s really high, which means there’s a strong chance they’ll respond well to this treatment. High percentages like that usually lead to a positive response, which is super encouraging.\n\nAlso, let's keep in mind that our patient is 61 years old. This age is typically okay for handling pembrolizumab, as long as they don’t have other health issues that are too concerning. Age alone usually isn't a dealbreaker when it comes to treatment effectiveness. \n\nI've read about clinical trials and studies, especially the KEYNOTE studies, which tell us that patients with high PD-L1 levels often see significant tumor shrinkage or at least disease stabilization with pembrolizumab. That’s pretty solid data supporting good outcomes.\n\nSo, putting this all together, given the patient's PD-L1 level at 95% and the fact that they’re on pembrolizumab, there's a really good chance that they’ll see a positive treatment response. Tumor reduction or keeping the disease in check seems pretty likely in this situation. This conclusion lines up with what clinical evidence suggests for cases like this, so I’m confident about it.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the clinical profile of a 61-year-old male patient with non-small cell carcinoma, a PD-L1 expression of 95%, and undergoing treatment with pembrolizumab, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
