Now, these sarcomatoid elements generally make the cancer more aggressive, which is a bit worrying.\n\nBut here's the thing, his PD-L1 expression is at a whopping 100%. When it comes to Pembrolizumab, a powerful immunotherapy drug that targets PD-1 inhibitors, this high PD-L1 expression is actually fantastic news.

There's a reasonable hope for a positive treatment response. This could mean a partial or maybe even a complete response to the treatment.\n\nNow, to back this up with some verification, high PD-L1 expression being favorable for treatment with Pembrolizumab isn't just a hunch. There's a substantial amount of clinical data showing that patients with expression levels at 50% or above respond significantly better to PD-1 inhibitors.
