Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's start by getting a good understanding of what's going on with the patient. I should think about their diagnosis first. What exactly is their condition? And at what stage is it? That will really help in figuring out how they might respond to treatment.\n\nOh right, the stage of the disease is pretty important. If the disease is just beginning, they might be aiming for a cure or at least getting it under control. But if it’s more advanced, then maybe treatments will focus more on making the patient comfortable or slowing things down as much as possible.\n\nNow, let’s see what treatments they’re currently receiving. Different therapies work in different ways, and their effectiveness can vary. I need to consider both how well these treatments generally work and what side effects they might have. Plus, knowing how similar cases have unfolded could give some insight into this patient's situation.\n\nI should also think about the individual characteristics of the patient. Are they young? Do they have other health issues? Generally, someone younger and in better health tends to have better treatment outcomes compared to someone older with a few more health challenges.\n\nWhat about the signs of how the disease is progressing? Are there any tests or imaging results that show how things are currently going? I need to find out if the disease is staying steady, seems to be shrinking, or unfortunately, if it’s advancing even with treatment.\n\nWith all this information in mind, I’d say it’s likely that the treatment is managing to keep the disease stable for now. It seems to have stopped further progression at least for the current moment.\n\nSo overall, everything seems to fit with what usually happens with patients who have similar profiles and are getting similar treatments.
