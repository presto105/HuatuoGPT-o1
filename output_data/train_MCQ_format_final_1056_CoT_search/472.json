    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer, which is pretty common, right? Especially, the L858R mutation - I've seen this pop up a lot when talking about lung cancer treatments. Now, this particular type of mutation is known for responding well to targeted therapies, and specifically to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which is a bit technical, but basically they are drugs that can interfere with the cancer cells' signaling pathways.\n\nNow, Afatinib comes into play here as it's a second-generation EGFR TKI. It's like an advanced version tailored to work on these kinds of mutations. The way it works is it permanently shuts down those overactive signals from the mutated EGFR protein. That's pretty cool because it kind of prevents the cancer from doing what it wants, you know?\n\nIf we look at patients who have this L858R mutation and are treated with Afatinib, they usually have good results. It's sort of expected. The drug tends to shrink the tumor and also helps the patient live without the cancer getting worse for a longer period of time. There's always some variability in medicine, but the track record here looks promising.\n\nThinking about this 60-year-old guy with that specific mutation taking Afatinib - I would totally expect him to see some positive effects. Likely, his tumor will shrink, and he'll have an improve period where he can actually live his life without the cancer getting out of hand again too soon.\n\nGiven what I've just gone through, I'm feeling pretty confident about being on the right track here. This conclusion fits with what I've learned from medical studies and how similar patients have responded in the past.
