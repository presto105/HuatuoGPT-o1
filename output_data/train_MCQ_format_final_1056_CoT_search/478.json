    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about this step-by-step. So, we've got a 73-year-old woman with adenocarcinoma, and we're talking about PD-L1 expression first. Hers is in the 1 to 49% range. From what I know, this level of PD-L1 isn't super high, it's kind of moderate. This means that immunotherapy could work, but it's not going to be as effective as it would be if she had PD-L1 expression of 50% or higher.\n\nNow, onto the EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 status - these are important for targeted therapies. Her tumor doesn't have mutations in EGFR, and it’s also negative for ALK and ROS1 rearrangements. So, that rules out some targeted therapies, meaning standard treatment like chemotherapy, possibly combined with immunotherapy if needed, is the way to go.\n\nLet’s talk about the chemotherapy she's on - pemetrexed and cisplatin. This combo is a pretty common first-line treatment for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, especially when there aren't any particular mutations to target. These drugs are known to be effective without specific driver mutations, although responses can vary.\n\nWhat's the expectation here with this chemo? Either the tumor shrinks somewhat, which we call a partial response, or the disease doesn't get worse - which would be stabilization. I’d guess that's what her doctors are hoping for. But, given that PD-L1 expression, there's always the option down the road to think about switching things up or adding immunotherapy to see if that might help even more.\n\nSo all in all, with this profile and treatment, I’d say she’s likely to see some tumor shrinkage or disease stabilization.\n\nJust to be sure, this fits well with typical expectations for a patient like her - adenocarcinoma, no driver mutations, moderate PD-L1 expression, on chemo.
