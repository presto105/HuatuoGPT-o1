    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about this situation. We have a 73-year-old woman who's been diagnosed with non-squamous cell carcinoma in her lungs, with the specific type being adenocarcinoma. That's a common type of lung cancer, okay easy to understand. Now, there's also something extra here - she has brain metastases, which means the cancer has spread to her brain. That's a bit more complex, making the situation a bit more challenging from a treatment perspective.\n\nNow, let's talk about this mutation - the EGFR L858R mutation. From what I know, this mutation can make the cancer grow uncontrollably because it affects the epidermal growth factor receptor on the cancer cells. But here's the thing, there's a treatment for that - gefitinib. It’s a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Wow, that's a mouthful! But basically, gefitinib targets and blocks that EGFR specifically. It's like having the perfect key for a lock on those mutated cancer cells.\n\nHmm, so what can we expect when she’s on gefitinib? Patients with this mutation often respond quite well to gefitinib. It tends to shrink the tumors and can help in controlling the disease progression. This is especially true for non-squamous lung adenocarcinoma, where this kind of mutation happens quite often. That’s promising.\n\nBut wait, there's the issue of brain metastases. Gefitinib is great, but when it comes to the brain, things get tricky because of the blood-brain barrier. It’s like a security system for the brain that keeps things out, including drugs sometimes. Some studies, though, have shown that gefitinib might actually work pretty well even in the brain. So, there’s hope.\n\nWrapping my head around this, it looks like this treatment plan could be there to work in her favor. The patient might see some shrinkage in tumor size and a slower disease progression. But, the brain situation needs careful watching.
