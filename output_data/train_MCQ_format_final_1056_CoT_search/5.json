    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this. Pembrolizumab is a type of drug that works by blocking a pathway used by cancer cells to escape detection by the immune system.

These genetic quirks can make the tumor trickier to treat because they can change how cancer cells behave and respond to drugs. Usually, without specific mutation data, these mutations can make the outlook more complex but don't necessarily supply a clear 'this will work better' answer. Tough stuff.\n\nAnd let's not overlook the patient's age, he's 77.
