    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's break this down. We're dealing with a cancer treatment regimen that uses a combo of Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin. It's interesting because this combination is a go-to for certain types of non-small cell lung cancer, specifically the non-squamous kind. If I remember correctly, Pembrolizumab targets something called PD-1, which is essential in all this.\n\nNow, I know that EGFR and ALK mutations usually require their own medications. So, for folks who don't have these specific mutations, or for those who've already dealt with targeted therapies and need something else, this combo treatment makes sense.\n\nPD-L1 expression, though, is another piece of the puzzle. Higher levels of PD-L1 generally mean a better chance of responding well to Pembrolizumab alone. But here's the thing: even if PD-L1 levels aren't sky-high, mixing it with chemotherapy, like this regimen, could still be quite effective.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about Tumor Mutational Burden, or TMB. A higher TMB might mean there are more neoantigens, which the immune system could recognize â€“ essentially giving the treatment a better shot at working. Although it doesn't get as much limelight as PD-L1, it's still valuable information.\n\nSo, if I put all these pieces together â€“ there are no EGFR or ALK mutations, PD-L1 levels could vary, and maybe there's a good TMB â€“ it sounds like this treatment could really work well. Especially if the cancer hasnâ€™t been treated with certain targeted therapies before.\n\nIn conclusion, taking everything into consideration, I would say the patient is likely to respond positively to Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin combo treatment, especially with high PD-L1 expression or high TMB, and as long as there are no EGFR or ALK mutations throwing a wrench in the plan.\n\nOh right, I just remembered that this kind of reasoning holds water because Pembrolizumab in such combinations is recognized for its effectiveness without those specific genetic mutations, even with varying PD-L1 levels.
