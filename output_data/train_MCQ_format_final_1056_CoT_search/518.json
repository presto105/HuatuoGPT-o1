    "<Internal Thinking>\nLet's start by understanding this patient's overall situation. We've got an 80-year-old man with adenocarcinoma, a type of non-squamous cell lung cancer. Now, what's interesting is his genetic profile. He's got an EGFR mutation, specifically the L858R type, which is a big marker when we're thinking about treatments.\n\nGiven this EGFR mutation, typically, those fancy targeted therapies like osimertinib are the go-to. These are usually preferred because they target the mutation directly, which often results in a better response than traditional chemotherapy.\n\nOh, and he's got 100% PD-L1 expression as wellâ€”basically, that means his tumor might respond nicely to immunotherapy. But hold on, letâ€™s not forget that EGFR mutant tumors don't usually play along well with immunotherapy.
