    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through step by step. We've got a 79-year-old male here who's been diagnosed with a type of lung cancer known as non-squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma. Oh, and it's not just hanging out in his lungs; it's decided to take a trip to the liver, which tells us we're dealing with Stage IV cancer. That's pretty serious.\n\nNow, let's consider the treatment he's on. He's getting Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. These are pretty standard drugs for his type of lung cancer. Pemetrexed is particularly used for non-squamous cancers like adenocarcinoma, and Cisplatin is a heavy hitter that amplifies the treatment impact. This duo makes sense clinically.\n\nBut here's a critical part of the puzzle: his cancer doesn't have those famous genetic mutations like EGFR mutations that allow doctors to use cool targeted drugs known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Instead, his EGFR is wild-type, meaning no mutations there to target, so we're sticking with conventional chemotherapy.\n\nWhen it comes to predicting how well he might respond to this treatment, hmm, things get a bit tricky. Elderly patients can indeed get some relief or symptom improvement from chemotherapy, but the benefits in terms of overall survival can often be modest. The cancer’s aggressive nature, combined with his age and any other health issues he might have, don’t make it easy.\n\nNow, liver metastasis is another big player here. It's quite a poor prognostic factor because it tends to indicate a more aggressive or widespread disease. And since we don’t have any targetable mutations, we're limited to the effects of chemotherapy, which usually leads to stable disease or maybe, if we're a bit luckier, a partial response. But hoping for a big tumor reduction or a long-term remission might not be very realistic in this case.\n\nOkay, to wrap this up, the most probable scenario is we might see some stabilization or a partial response to the chemotherapy, but significant and long-lasting regression of the cancer isn't very likely.
