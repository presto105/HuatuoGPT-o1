    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think this through step by step. First up, we have Pembrolizumab in the mix. I know it's an immune checkpoint inhibitor and usually, the effectiveness of Pembrolizumab is closely tied to PD-L1 expression levels. Hmm, this patient has 0% PD-L1 expression, which initially doesn't bode well for Pembrolizumab, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of tumor mutational burden. I've read that a higher TMB often means there's a wider array of mutations, potentially creating more targets for the immune system. This guy's TMB clocked in at 17.4 mutations per megabase, which is on the higher end. So, that's a pretty big plus because high TMB can really juice up the response to immune therapies like Pembrolizumab.\n\nNow let's not forget, we're not just looking at Pembrolizumab flying solo here. The patient is also on Pemetrexed and Carboplatin, which are solid chemotherapeutics, especially in non-squamous cell carcinoma cases like this one. This type of combo therapy with Pembrolizumab is part of the standard regimen for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Oh, and it doesn’t really matter that much if PD-L1 is low given how the combo is approved for use regardless of PD-L1 expression.\n\nIt's interesting to consider the impact of histology. With an adenocarcinoma in play, this aligns with how Pembrolizumab is often tested, particularly in Keynote trials. I've seen studies where patients with low or non-existent PD-L1 still got benefits from this sort of treatment, mostly when they had a high TMB.\n\nFinally, when I put it all together—the high TMB, the comprehensive chemo combo, the solid clinical trial results—I have a strong hunch that this patient will likely respond positively to the treatment regimen. Despite the low PD-L1, everything else seems to point towards a favorable outcome. Yep, this treatment plan seems capable of packing a punch thanks to everything else going in this patient's favor.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 72-year-old male patient with non-squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma histology, who has wild-type EGFR status, 0% PD-L1 expression, no liver or brain metastasis, and is receiving a treatment regimen of Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin, with a tumor mutational burden of 17.4 mutations/Mb, what is the most likely response to the treatment?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
