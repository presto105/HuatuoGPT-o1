    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, we have an older woman, she's 71, with adenocarcinoma. That's a type of lung cancer, right? And she has this special kind of mutation called EGFR E19del. Now, this mutation often responds to certain drugs, particularly TKIs, which are these tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ah, and afatinib is one of those drugs that's a second-generation TKI. It's specially known to be effective for people with this kind of EGFR mutation. From what I've read, afatinib works by blocking the signals that make these cancer cells grow. That's pretty important.\n\nHmm, now the trickier part. She also has these brain metastases, which complicates the situation a bit. Brain metastases can be quite tough because of the blood-brain barrier, which usually blocks a lot of treatments from reaching the brain. But, thankfully, afatinib has some ability to get through this barrier, which means it could help treat those brain mets too. That’s actually really hopeful for her treatment.\n\nSo, if we're looking at how effective this treatment would be, the literature suggests that patients with this profile might see a partial response. What that means is the cancer could shrink but may not disappear entirely. There's also the possibility of disease stabilization, where the cancer doesn't grow any more but doesn't shrink much either. Given her mutation and treatment with afatinib, these outcomes are quite likely.\n\nAll in all, I would expect that she might see some positive changes with the treatment. Of course, each patient can respond differently, but based on the data, a partial response or keeping the cancer stable sounds like what most people with a similar background experience.\n\nThat's it, I think this is a pretty reasonable expectation given all the factors in play.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 71-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma, an EGFR E19del mutation, brain metastasis, and treated with afatinib, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
