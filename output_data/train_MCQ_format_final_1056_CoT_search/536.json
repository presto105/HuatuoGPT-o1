    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's try to wrap our heads around this. So, the patient's dealing with squamous cell carcinoma, and it's already spread to the liver and brain. Yikes.

That usually gives us a bit of a challenge when it comes to treatment options, especially without those nifty mutations like EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 that we could target. \n\nNow, let's think about the treatment plan. They're on Gemcitabine and Carboplatin. I know these are pretty common picks for advanced squamous cell cases because they go after those fast-dividing cancer cells.
