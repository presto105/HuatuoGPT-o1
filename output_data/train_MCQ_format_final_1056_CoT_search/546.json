Ah, right, Afatinib is a go-to first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer when these mutations are involved.

It's still good to be mindful of, though, just in case.\n\nAlso, there's the brain metastasis angle. I know brain metastases can complicate treatment. But, wait, we've seen some data suggesting EGFR TKIs work on brain mets too, right? Afatinib, in particular, has shown some good results there. It can cross that blood-brain barrier, which is a bonus.\n\nSo, considering the mutation and the drug's penetration into the CNS, this patient should likely do well. I’d expect some significant tumor shrinkage and maybe even some relief from symptoms linked to those brain metastases. Oh, and let's not forget: balancing all this with the acknowledgement of Afatinib's known action, it aligns with treatment guidelines for EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nHonestly, when piecing all this together, the patient is prone to have a positive response to Afatinib.
