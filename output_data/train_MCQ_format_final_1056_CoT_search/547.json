    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's figure this out step by step. Adenocarcinoma is a type of non-small cell lung cancer that's not squamous, and it's quite common.

These two work pretty well together for non-squamous types because they’ve shown good results with balanced side effects.\n\nNow, about those KRAS and PIK3CA mutations. KRAS mutations pop up often in these cases, and while they can mess with how some targeted drugs work, like those EGFR inhibitors, they don't really mess with traditional chemo like Pemetrexed/Cisplatin. On the other hand, PIK3CA mutations—those are involved in growth pathways like PI3K/AKT. But you know, in practice, they're not known for messing with how chemo works either. So, these mutations shouldn’t change how the chemo performs.\n\nWhen we talk about chemotherapy with Pemetrexed/Cisplatin, it's generally effective for non-squamous NSCLC. So assuming there aren’t any hidden resistances, we would expect the treatment to keep the disease under control.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the age factor here. Our patient is 83 years old, which means we have to keep an eye on how she’s handling the treatment. This age might make tolerability a concern, but under supportive care, the treatment can still be effective.\n\nIn the end, for our patient—an 83-year-old female with adenocarcinoma and those specific mutations—the response to Pemetrexed/Cisplatin should be in line with what we typically see in non-squamous NSCLC. The mutations don’t give us any big red flags about resistance, so we’re looking at disease stabilization being a good possibility.\n\nI’ve reviewed all the ins and outs of the treatment, checked how these mutations play into it, and looked at the usual outcomes.
