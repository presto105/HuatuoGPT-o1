    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, so we're dealing with an 83-year-old man who has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma that's spread to his brain. This definitely tells us that the cancer is pretty advanced, and brain metastasis often complicates things. Now, looking at his PD-L1 expression, it's in the 1-49% range, which is interesting. This means there's some level of expression but it's not considered high, which might influence treatment choices but isn't the main criterion all on its own, especially since he's older.\n\nNow, he's on Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. Hmm, this is a classic combination for tackling non-small cell lung cancer, especially for adenocarcinoma. It's kind of like the go-to regimen when there's disease progression, and no specific mutations steering the treatment in a different direction like EGFR or ALK. But we have to remember, he's got brain metastases, which can make treating this even trickier.\n\nSo, how well is this treatment likely to work? In these advanced cases with brain metastases, treatments like Pemetrexed and Cisplatin generally aim to shrink the tumors or at least stop them from growing so fast. A complete remission might be hoping for too much, but seeing the tumors shrink a bit or at least getting them to a manageable state where they're not worsening - that's more realistic. Maybe partial response or stable disease is what we're aiming for here.\n\nThe thing about that moderate PD-L1 expression is that it could open doors to immunotherapy down the line if this chemo doesn't get us where we need to go. But, since the PD-L1 isn't super high, it doesn't necessarily make immunotherapy a slam dunk right from the start, especially since the cancer has reached the brain.\n\nSo, putting all of this together, with the Pemetrexed and Cisplatin regimen, we're likely looking at a partial response or stable disease for this patient.
