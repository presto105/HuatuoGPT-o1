    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through step by step. We've got a 66-year-old guy dealing with non-squamous cell lung cancer. Oh, and there are brain metastases involved—yikes, that's definitely a serious complication. Now, the treatment plan is quite intense: there's Tremelimumab and Durvalumab on board. I remember these are immune checkpoint inhibitors, so they must be trying to rev up the immune system to fight the cancer. That’s pretty clever given how these drugs can help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. \n\nThen we've got Pemetrexed and Carboplatin in the mix. Right, those are heavy hitters from the chemo world. They typically work by trying to stop cancer from growing or spreading by damaging its DNA, which sounds pretty necessary here considering the brain mets. It seems like they're throwing everything at this, which makes sense because we want to control this aggressive disease as much as possible. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about his cancer markers—he’s EGFR wild type and ALK negative. That means we can't use targeted therapies that some patients benefit from, like EGFR or ALK inhibitors. So, those immunotherapy agents combined with chemo become even more crucial in this case. \n\nThe PD-L1 expression caught my eye too. It's between 1% and 49%. Ah, I remember some lecture or paper pointing out that patients with some level of PD-L1 expression might have a response to checkpoint inhibitors. It's not super high, but there’s potential here, definitely not to be overlooked. \n\nGiven all these factors—the aggressive dual-approach with immunotherapy ramping up the immune system, chemo actively attacking the cancer, and the specific genetic profile—I'm thinking the most reasonable expectation is either a reduction in tumor size or, at the very least, keeping things from getting worse.
