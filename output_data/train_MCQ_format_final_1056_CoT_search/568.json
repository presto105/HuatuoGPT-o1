    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's break this down bit by bit. So, the patient is dealing with non-small cell lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma, along with L858R and T790M mutations. These are pretty common when talking about this type of lung cancer. I know the L858R mutation hits exon 21 in the EGFR gene, which is often a target for certain cancer treatments. Then there's the T790M mutation. That one is a bit pesky because it tends to produce resistance after using some of the earlier EGFR-targeted therapies.\n\nNow, there's a big factor here – the brain metastasis. Brain metastasis can really complicate things because most chemotherapies struggle to get past the blood-brain barrier. That's a significant hurdle. It means treatments or therapies that can actually reach the brain are generally going to be more suitable.\n\nLet's talk about what the patient is currently on. They're being treated with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. This is a classic chemotherapy mix for non-small cell lung cancer, especially if you're looking at non-squamous types. But here's the catch – these treatments don't specifically hone in on those EGFR mutations, especially when there's brain involvement.\n\nHmm, knowing about the T790M mutation throws a bit of intrigue. There's a third-gen EGFR inhibitor, Osimertinib, that's well known for its effectiveness here; it's pretty savvy in crossing the blood-brain barrier and targeting that T790M mutation directly. If I was making a call on what's potentially more effective, I'd be leaning towards Osimertinib, given the specific mutations and the brain situation.\n\nBut wait, why might they have been started on Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in the first place? Maybe it was because the disease was progressing quickly, and they needed something broad-spectrum right away. Or perhaps the mutation results weren't fully available when the treatment started. There are a lot of factors in play.\n\nGosh, it's really a dance between understanding the broad effectiveness of traditional chemotherapy against the precise assault of a targeted therapy. For the presence of these mutations and brain metastasis, Osimertinib looks like it'd be the better choice quite clearly. It feels like the current regimen might not be quite hitting the mark.\n\nIn conclusion, taking everything into account, switching to Osimertinib could offer a more promising response.
