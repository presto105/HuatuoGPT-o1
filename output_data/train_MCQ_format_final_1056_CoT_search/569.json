    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this a bit. Lazertinib—I've heard of that. It's used for treating certain types of non-small cell lung cancer. You know, the kind with specific EGFR mutations. It’s a third-generation drug, which is interesting because that usually means it’s tackling something those older treatments couldn’t quite handle.\n\nNow, the patient here is a 65-year-old lady with adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of lung cancer among non-smokers, especially in Asian women. That’s right in line with where we often see EGFR mutations popping up. So, hmm, this seems like Lazertinib might just be the right call for her.\n\nThinking more on genetic mutations, I remember the ones we're really looking at here with EGFR inhibitors are the exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation. Lazertinib comes in particularly handy with the T790M mutation, because that one indicates resistance to earlier drugs. If she’s got this mutation, it would explain why Lazertinib is on the table—it’s supposed to be quite effective against that specific hurdle.\n\nSo, if she's receiving Lazertinib, there’s a pretty good chance she’s got that pesky T790M mutation. With the drug being so effective for people like her, we’d expect some kind of tumor reduction or at least stable disease. That’s typically how these things play out with this treatment.\n\nWait, let’s verify. Yeah, everything I’ve read and seen indicates that Lazertinib works well for T790M mutation cases. Makes sense why this would be her treatment path. If she’s responding as expected, I’d bet she’s seeing some positive changes in her condition, like the tumor shrinking or not growing further. It all adds up.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile and genetic mutations of a 65-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma being treated with Lazertinib, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
