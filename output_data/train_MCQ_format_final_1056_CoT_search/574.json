    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through. We've got an 82-year-old male here, diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, and to make matters more complicated, there are liver metastases involved. Typically, treating liver metastases can be quite challenging, so this already sets the stage for a complex case.\n\nNow, one crucial piece of information is the PD-L1 expression. In this case, it's greater than 50%. From what I know, PD-1 inhibitors like Pembrolizumab work pretty well when PD-L1 levels are high. Why? Because high PD-L1 expression means the tumor cells might be more vulnerable to an immune system attack, and that's exactly what Pembrolizumab is engineered to do – block that PD-1/PD-L1 pathway enabling the immune system to recognize and fight these cancer cells.\n\nLet’s also consider the patient's age. At 82, age itself can be a factor, but assuming he's in relatively good health, older patients can respond to immunotherapy just like younger ones. Plus, it's not uncommon for clinicians to weigh the potential benefits of immunotherapy even in older patients if the circumstances seem promising.\n\nLooking at this case, there's substantial evidence suggesting that patients with high PD-L1 expression have better outcomes with Pembrolizumab. Clinical studies back this up – they show trends of tumor shrinkage and disease stabilization more often in patients with high PD-L1 expression.\n\nSo, thinking about all of this, his high PD-L1 expression suggests a higher chance of a good outcome – maybe we'll see the tumors reduce in size or the disease stabilize. Of course, there's always that element of unpredictability with cancer treatment, but all signs point towards a favorable response.\n\nYes, I’d say, given all the information, expecting a positive response seems like a reasonable conclusion. Let’s put a pin in that for now, and keep our fingers crossed for a good outcome here.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the provided clinical profile of an 82-year-old male patient with squamous cell carcinoma with liver metastasis, a PD-L1 expression level greater than 50%, and a treatment regimen of Pembrolizumab, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
