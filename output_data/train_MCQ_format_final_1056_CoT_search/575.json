Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the question is as follows:\n\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question involves evaluating the clinical profile of a cancer patient, considering various genetic markers, PD-L1 expression levels, and the treatment regimen to predict the likely treatment response. This requires a deep understanding of oncology and molecular biology, particularly in the context of lung adenocarcinoma treatment responses. Therefore, the question requires deeper reasoning and cannot be classified as \"Too Simple\".\n\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question provides a unique and specific clinical scenario with a single correct response (SD for Stable Disease), based on the provided data, especially considering the PD-L1 levels and the treatment regimen. There is no ambiguity about the choice. Thus, the question does not have an \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question could be reformulated into an open-ended format by asking: \"Based on the patient's clinical and molecular profile and the given treatment regimen, what is the most likely treatment response?\" This allows for a detailed analysis of the reasons leading to the prediction of Stable Disease. Thus, it is \"Reformulatable\".\n\nTherefore, the appropriate evaluation for this question is \"Pass\" as it meets all the criteria.",
