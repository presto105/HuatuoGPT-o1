    "<Internal Thinking>\nSo, I have this 62-year-old female patient with a lung adenocarcinoma. Alright, let's think about her genetic profile because that will tell us a lot about what treatment will work best.\n\nFirst thing I notice is that she doesn't have any mutations in EGFR. That's interesting because a lot of times we look for those EGFR mutations as potential targets for therapy. But okay, not all hope is lost, let's see what else we've got.\n\nOh, she's also negative for ALK rearrangements. This means another door to targeted therapies is closed.

That changes things! This RET fusion opens the door for a targeted therapy called Selpercatinib. This drug is specifically for tumors with RET alterations, so that’s definitely our target here.\n\nI remember reading that Selpercatinib is pretty effective for RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancers. Clinical trials showed that many patients had good responses—like their tumors shrunk and they had longer periods before the disease progressed.\n\nAlso, I think the fact that there’s no metastasis to the liver or brain could mean her overall condition might be more manageable with this targeted treatment.\n\nSo putting all of this together, I would expect that Selpercatinib should give her a positive treatment response. I’m thinking there should be some tumor shrinkage and hopefully a better progression-free survival.\n\nIt all seems to fit with what I’ve learned about RET fusion-positive cancers and their treatment pathways.
