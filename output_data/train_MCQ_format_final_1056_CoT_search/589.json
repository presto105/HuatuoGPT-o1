    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's start by breaking down this treatment plan for the 62-year-old man with adenocarcinoma. So, he's on Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin at first. That's quite a powerful combo. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, and it's especially handy if the cancer has PD-L1 expression. Hmm, PD-L1 is a biomarker that tells us Pembrolizumab could really work here, because it helps the immune system see the cancer cells more clearly.\n\nNow, Pemetrexed and Carboplatin are chemotherapy agents.

We're likely to see either the tumor getting smaller or at least not getting any bigger. Hmm, in clinical terms, that's a partial response or stable disease.\n\nAnd if we look at past studies and trials, they back this up. Pembrolizumab with chemo shows better results in patients with the right biomarkers. So, with Lenvatinib joining the regimen later, it seems like it would just further lock in the disease control.\n\nOverall, considering all these factors, the patient's most probable response to this treatment plan would likely be a partial response or stabilization of the adenocarcinoma.
