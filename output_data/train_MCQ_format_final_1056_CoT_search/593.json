    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about this. We're dealing with a patient who has non-squamous adenocarcinoma of the lung. That's a type of lung cancer, and it's tricky because lung cancer can behave differently depending on a bunch of factors. One important thing here is the PD-L1 expression. Ah, PD-L1! That's a protein that, when expressed, can sometimes tell us how likely a cancer is to respond to immunotherapy. This patient's PD-L1 expression is between 1 and 49%. Okay, so that's not super high, but it's also not absent. In the world of biomarkers, we call this a moderate level. It means that there's a reasonable chance that the immunotherapy could work, but it's not a guarantee.\n\nNow, speaking of immunotherapy, let's remember how it works. It’s a treatment that taps into the body's own immune system. Imagine it's like giving the immune system a little nudge to recognize and fight the cancer cells more effectively. Medications like pembrolizumab come to mind here. They're often used in conjunction with chemotherapy in cases that share this PD-L1 expression range. Combining the two therapies makes sense because while immunotherapy gives that gentle push to the immune system, chemo goes in guns blazing, directly attacking the cancer cells.\n\nChemotherapy alone has been the standard for a long time, and it can really help with reducing tumor size and alleviating symptoms. When you pair chemo with immunotherapy, especially when dealing with non-squamous types and moderate PD-L1 expression, research has shown there can be better results than chemo alone. The studies I've come across typically report improved progression-free survival and overall survival rates when both treatments are combined, especially in patients with lung cancer like the one we're discussing.\n\nSo, what should we expect in terms of treatment response? The combination approach gives hope for a favorable response, perhaps a partial one. A partial response means the cancer might shrink but probably not disappear entirely. There's also a chance for stable disease, where the cancer doesn’t necessarily shrink but doesn’t grow either. Considering all the context—the cancer type, the PD-L1 level, and the treatment being used—there's a solid base to assume some positive response.\n\nLooking at clinical trials and data, they regularly support this expectation. Patients with similar cancer portraits often experience a partial or stable disease state when treated with the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. So, in summary, given everything we know, it's reasonable to conclude that for this patient, the most likely outcome seems to be a partial response or at least maintaining the disease at a stable phase.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 59-year-old patient with stage non-squamous adenocarcinoma lung cancer, a PD-L1 expression of 1-49%, and receiving immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>. The response style should resemble GPT-4's style as much as possible. Output only your final response, without any additional content."
