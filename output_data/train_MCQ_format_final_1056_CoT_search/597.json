    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 67-year-old man dealing with adenocarcinoma and a smoking history. Knowing this, the usual approach might involve exploring how his cancer’s likely to respond to different treatments.\n\nFirst off, Pembrolizumab. It's designed to bind with PD-1, and that helps the immune system find and attack cancer cells. This usually works well if there’s high PD-L1 expression, but hmmm, his is 0%.
