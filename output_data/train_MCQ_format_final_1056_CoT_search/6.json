    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so we have a 71-year-old woman dealing with lung adenocarcinoma, a type of non-small cell lung cancer, and she's never even smoked. That's pretty interesting because it means her cancer might not be associated with typical smoking-related mutations. Now, about her genetic profile — she has an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation. These mutations are kind of tricky because they often don't respond well to the usual EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors like gefitinib or erlotinib. So, that's a bit of a roadblock for EGFR-targeted therapy options.\n\nLet's think about her PD-L1 status next. It's sitting at 0%, which suggests she's unlikely to benefit much, if at all, from immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab. These drugs usually work better when PD-L1 expression is higher because they boost T-cell response against the tumor. Also, her tumor mutational burden (TMB) is pretty low at 2.4 mutations per megabase. A low TMB often means there's not a complex mutation landscape for the immune system to target, so immunotherapy doesn't seem like a promising route here either.\n\nSo, we've got a situation where targeted therapy isn't an option due to the exon 20 insertion, and immunotherapy isn't likely to be effective either. That pretty much narrows it down to chemotherapy as the remaining viable option. She's being treated with a Pemetrexed and Carboplatin combination. This regimen is quite standard for non-squamous NSCLC like adenocarcinoma because it's fairly well-tolerated and has decent effectiveness in situations where other treatments aren't suitable.\n\nGiven her clinical and molecular profile, I'd expect a moderate response to this chemo regimen. By moderate, I mean she might see some tumor shrinkage and disease control, which is a positive outcome when considering the limitations posed by her low PD-L1 and TMB plus the exon 20 mutation. It's a solid treatment choice considering the circumstances—especially when you play into account that we're limited in more specific targeted or immunotherapy avenues. Yep, moderate response seems about right here!\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven a 71-year-old female patient with a clinical profile of adenocarcinoma at the non-small cell lung cancer stage, who has never smoked, shows no liver or brain metastasis, has an EGFR E20ins mutation with no ALK rearrangement, a PD-L1 expression of 0%, and a TMB of 2.4 mutations/Mb, and is undergoing treatment with Pemetrexed/Carboplatin, what is the most likely treatment response expected from this regimen?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
