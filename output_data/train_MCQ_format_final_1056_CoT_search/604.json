    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, so we're looking at Gefitinib and its role in treating cancers with specific mutations. We know Gefitinib is an EGFR inhibitor. That's a pretty specific type of targeted therapy! It's designed to go after cancers where there's something wrong — like a mutation — in the EGFR gene.\n\nNow, let's think about those mutations. EGFR mutations can make the receptor signaling go haywire, causing the cancer cells to grow uncontrollably. For Gefitinib to really do its thing, we need the patient to have certain mutations in their EGFR gene. The most common ones that come to mind are exon 19 deletions or the L858R mutation.\n\nThinking about our patient here, she's 88. That's pretty up there in years, and age can sometimes play a role in how patients handle cancer treatments. But then again, age doesn't really change how the cancer cells themselves will respond to the drug, right? So, even at 88, if she's got the right mutations, Gefitinib could work really well.\n\nLet’s connect the dots here. Patients with those common EGFR mutations, like exon 19 deletions or the L858R mutation, usually show a good response to Gefitinib. We're talking tumor shrinkage and better progression-free survival. So assuming she has one of these mutations, she's likely to see some positive changes.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if we're betting on mutation-response here, and she has one of those mutations, we would expect a good outcome. Her tumors should shrink, and symptoms should improve.\n\nYeah, going over how Gefitinib works and its proven track record, it seems solid — as long as her genetic profile matches the drug's target, she's in for a good response.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the provided clinical profile of an 88-year-old female patient with specific genetic mutations and targeted therapy with Gefitinib, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
