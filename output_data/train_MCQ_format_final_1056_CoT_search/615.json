    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's figure out how this plays out for someone with ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer who's taking Crizotinib. So, Crizotinib is known as a targeted therapy. What that means is it's specifically designed to go after the ROS1 tyrosine kinase receptor. When it does that, it kind of puts a halt on tumor growth, and this can really make the tumor shrink.\n\nWhy is that important? Well, in clinical trials, Crizotinib has shown a pretty impressive response rate for patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC. We're talking about most patients seeing significant improvements compared to if they were just on regular chemotherapy. These studies give us numbers like progression-free survival and overall survival that look really good in favor of Crizotinib.\n\nNow, when you think about these response rates, they usually mean that patients get to see their tumors shrink noticeably. It might not be complete for everyone, but partial or complete responses are not rare at all. This is all because Crizotinib hones in directly on the ROS1 mutation, and that laser focus is what makes it so effective initially.\n\nBut, oh, let's not forget about resistance. As with a lot of cancer treatments, some people might find that the drug stops being as effective over time. It's one of those things you'd have to look out for. Still, even with that, Crizotinib does its job well enough right from the start for most people, giving them better disease control compared to just traditional approaches.\n\nSo, to sum it up and put it in perspective: given this patient's ROS1-positive profile and the fact they're on Crizotinib, they're very likely to see a good amount of tumor shrinkage and stability in their disease. And, you know what, all the data backs this up, so it seems like a pretty solid expectation from what's been documented in clinical studies.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the specified patient clinical profile, including positive ROS1 status and treatment with Crizotinib, what is the most likely treatment response in terms of effectiveness?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
