    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's see what's going on here. The patient is being treated with Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin. This combination is pretty standard for non-squamous NSCLC, especially when the cancer has spread. Pembrolizumab is this cool drug that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells by targeting something called PD-1. Meanwhile, Pemetrexed and Carboplatin are the classic duo of chemotherapy agents taking a more traditional approach to attack the cancer.\n\nNow, checking the biomarker status. The patient has a wild-type EGFR, and both ALK and ROS1 rearrangements are negative. These are typical genetic changes that can guide therapy massively, but not in this case since they're absent.\n\nNext up, PD-L1 expression. Oof, it's 0%. That’s crucial because Pembrolizumab usually works better when PD-L1 is higher, so a 0% suggests the cancer cells aren't showing this protein at all. This setup makes it tougher for Pembrolizumab to work its magic.\n\nAnd there's the brain aspect — brain metastasis. Always tricky. Some treatments can reach the brain, but results can be hit or miss. Pembrolizumab and chemotherapy might have some effect on brain lesions, but it's a mixed bag at best.\n\nLet's not forget TMB, which is sitting at 3.9 mutations/Mb. In simpler terms, that's considered on the lower side. High TMB often predicts better odds with immunotherapy because the immune system has more targets to attack. So lower here might mean a weaker response.\n\nSo, putting all of this together, the low PD-L1 and TMB suggest the Pembrolizumab part might not work great. The chemotherapy could still do its job, but overall, expecting a major turnaround might be optimistic.\n\nWhen you stack this all up, it seems more likely that we might get a kind of moderate or limited response. The patient might maintain stable disease or get some reduction in tumor size but achieving complete remission or a major improvement could be challenging.\n\nOverall, it feels like the reasoning matches what we know about the science here. In cases like this, with low PD-L1 and TMB, it's hard to count on immunotherapy alone for dramatic results.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven a 65-year-old male patient with non-squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma, no liver metastasis, but brain metastasis, a wild-type EGFR status, negative ALK and ROS1 status, 0% PD-L1 expression, and TMB of 3.9 mutations/Mb, who is undergoing treatment with Pembrolizumab combined with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.

Typically, higher PD-L1 expression and TMB are associated with better responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors like Pembrolizumab. \n\nHowever, the combination with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin, which are standard chemotherapy agents, could still offer some level of disease control. Given this setup, the most likely treatment response for this patient might involve achieving stable disease or a modest reduction in tumor size. While the combination therapy may help manage the cancer, expecting a major improvement or complete remission may be overly optimistic due to the biomarker considerations.",
  "Question": "Given a 65-year-old male patient with non-squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma, no liver metastasis, but brain metastasis, a wild-type EGFR status, negative ALK and ROS1 status, 0% PD-L1 expression, and TMB of 3.9 mutations/Mb, who is undergoing treatment with Pembrolizumab combined with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin, what is the most likely treatment response?"
