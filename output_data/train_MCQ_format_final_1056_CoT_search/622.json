    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about EGFR mutations and what they mean for adenocarcinoma treatment. We know that in non-small cell lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, mutations in the EGFR gene are pretty common. And when we hear about mutations like the exon 19 deletion, these are the ones that often respond well to targeted therapies. So, what does this mean for treatment?\n\nWell, Gefitinib comes into play here. It's a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. What it does is target the mutated EGFR proteins, which you find a lot in these patients. This means it can specifically hone in on the cancer cells that are out of control, pretty cool, right? This is why it's called targeted therapy.\n\nNow, when it comes to outcomes, patients with this exon 19 deletion usually see really good responses to Gefitinib. We're talking about high rates of tumor shrinkage and relief from cancer symptoms, which is a huge win for patients. It's quite common for these patients to see their progression-free survival improve when compared to those on standard chemotherapy.\n\nLooking at clinical studies, they paint a pretty optimistic picture. The response rate for patients who have this mutation and are treated with Gefitinib is around 70-80%. That's quite high and suggests significant tumor shrinkage and fewer symptoms. So, clinical improvement is pretty much expected.\n\nAlright, putting all of this together for our 49-year-old patient, she has this specific mutation and is being treated with Gefitinib. So, what we're expecting is a pretty good response. This means tumor size reduction and symptomatic relief are likely on the horizon for her.\n\nAnd when I check this against what I know from research and clinical data, it all seems to align perfectly. The high response rate to Gefitinib in patients with this specific mutation suggests substantial benefits for this patient. So, yes, I think this reasoning holds up well. It's likely she'll see a big improvement.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 49-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma, EGFR E19del mutation, and undergoing targeted therapy with Gefitinib, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
