    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's see what we're dealing with here. We have a 77-year-old gentleman diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. That's a type of cancer that arises in the glandular tissues, and it's good to know that there's no spread to his liver or brain. That's definitely a plus. Now, looking at his PD-L1 level, it's sitting at 0%, which is crucial because PD-L1 is a biomarker that can guide us towards immunotherapy options. But at 0%, it tells us that immunotherapy might not be beneficial here, unfortunately. \n\nNext up, we have to consider the results for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1. They're all negative, huh. These are other important biomarkers for targeted therapies. Usually, if any were positive, we'd have a tailor-made treatment path, but since they're not, we'll have to look elsewhere. Hmm, let's move on to the chemotherapy he's on—Pemetrexed/Cisplatin. It's a pretty standard choice for our case when no targeted therapies are available, particularly for lung adenocarcinoma. \n\nNow, KRAS mutation is present, and KRAS is a tricky one. I mean, it's quite common in cases of non-small cell lung cancer, but it sometimes hints at a grim outlook, as it can mean the cancer might not respond well to certain treatments. But alas, there's no direct drug yet to target it, still something to keep in mind. \n\nHm, there's also a SMAD4 mutation in the mix, which often means the cancer could behave more aggressively. Like KRAS, it doesn’t offer direct treatment paths but certainly makes the situation more complex. And then we have STK11 mutations. These guys are infamous for making cancer resistant to immunotherapies and also suggesting poorer outcomes overall. This can indeed make the treatments less effective, but we're out of targeted options, so we'll just have to hope for the best from the chemotherapy.\n\nConsidering all of this, I suppose with Pemetrexed/Cisplatin, I'd expect that the treatment could lead to either a partial response or possibly the disease remaining stable. Sadly, those mutations, especially KRAS and STK11, might dampen our hopes. \n\nBut boil it all down, and while there'll be hurdles, given what we have, this chemo is likely the best shot.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 77-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma, no liver or brain metastasis, a PD-L1 level of 0%, and negative EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 status, who is undergoing Pemetrexed/Cisplatin chemotherapy with KRAS, SMAD4, and STK11 SNV mutations, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
