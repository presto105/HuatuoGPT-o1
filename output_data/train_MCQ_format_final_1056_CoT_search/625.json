Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let’s think about what's happening here. The patient is on a mix of drugs: Durvalumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin. Now, Durvalumab—I've heard of that. It’s one of those fancy immunotherapy drugs. It blocks PD-L1, which is kind of like unlocking the immune system's full power against the cancer. Interesting combo!

They go straight to the cancer cells and try to stop them in their tracks.\n\nNow, what's up with that high PD-L1 expression? High PD-L1 usually means a better fight back with immunotherapy.
