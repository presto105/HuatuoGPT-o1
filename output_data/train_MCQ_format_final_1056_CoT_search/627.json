    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's take a closer look at what's going on with this patient. We have a 75-year-old man who's dealing with adenocarcinoma, a kind of non-small cell lung cancer. That's never easy, especially since it's spread to his liver and brain. I mean, that already sets quite a serious tone. \n\nNow, when we dive into the genetic profile of this tumor, we see it's wild-type for EGFR. So, no mutations there that we could target with EGFR inhibitors. That's a bummer because those drugs can sometimes work wonders. Then, there's the ALK status, which is also negative. Unfortunately, this means ALK inhibitors are off the table as well. \n\nOh, and let's check out the PD-L1 expression. It's kind of surprising, actually, it's at 0%. Usually, PD-L1 expression helps us predict how well Pembrolizumab—a type of immunotherapy—will work, so having none isn't very encouraging for a robust immune response.\n\nBut the patient is on a treatment regimen. It combines Pembrolizumab with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin. Those last two are chemotherapy agents, and together they're known to pack a punch against NSCLC. Typically, they try to use the chemo to make the cancer cells more vulnerable to the immune system, hence the combination! \n\nConsidering all these details, what are we thinking about his treatment response here? Well, I'd say that even though Pembrolizumab might not be pulling its weight due to that 0% PD-L1, Pemetrexed and Carboplatin are still solid options. They've shown to help stabilize the disease or even lead to partial shrinkage.\n\nIn my gut, I feel that the best we could hope for is a partial response. At the very least, there should be some stabilization. Of course, that's primarily thanks to the effects of the chemotherapy agents.  \n\nI've checked similar patient profiles, and it looks like it supports my hunch.
