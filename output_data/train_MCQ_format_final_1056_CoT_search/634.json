    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about this. So we have a 66-year-old guy with a pretty specific type of lung cancer, right? It's adenocarcinoma, and they found that it has this ROS1 genetic alteration. Hmm, that's interesting because ROS1-positive cancers typically respond well to certain targeted drugs. They've got this medication called Crizotinib, which specifically targets those genetic quirks, ROS1 rearrangements.\n\nNow, Crizotinib is usually quite good at shrinking tumors and keeping the cancer from getting worse. That's its job, you know—it's designed to inhibit specific kinases like ROS1, and another one called ALK, but let's not go off on a tangent about ALK right now.\n\nOh, but here's a hitch. The patient also has brain metastases, and from what I understand, Crizotinib isn't the greatest at getting into the brain. There’s this thing called the blood-brain barrier, a sort of protective shield for our brains, and unfortunately, Crizotinib has some trouble crossing it. I mean, it does get through a little bit, but not as effectively as we might like. This means it's not as potent against tumors in the brain as it is elsewhere in the body.\n\nAlso, given this situation, it seems likely that we'll see a mixed response. Outside the brain, where the drug can do its thing unimpeded, we might see some nice shrinkage of the tumors or at least keep things stable. But in the brain, its effect could be more limited. You're probably going to expect what's called a partial response, where you get some significant reduction in tumor size outside of the brain but not as much action on those brain metastases.\n\nSo, to sum up—and let’s see if we can verify this—Crizotinib is likely to work well on the areas of cancer outside of the central nervous system, but due to its limited ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, its effect on brain metastases might not be as pronounced. That seems to add up with what’s generally known. The most likely scenario is a partial response with better outcomes outside the CNS.
