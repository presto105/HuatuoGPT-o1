    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through one step at a time. We've got a 62-year-old male dealing with adenocarcinoma, which falls under non-small cell lung cancer.

Well, given that the patient is being treated with Afatinib, and considering the EGFR E19del mutation's responsiveness, we're likely looking at a pretty positive outcome in terms of reducing tumor size and halting progression for a while.\n\nSo, to wrap it all up, with the specific mutation the patient has, Afatinib is a solid plan. We can anticipate a pretty favorable response, which might translate into significant tumor shrinkage and an extended period before any progression.
