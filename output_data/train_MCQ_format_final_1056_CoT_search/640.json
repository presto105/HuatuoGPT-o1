    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think this through. The patient is on a treatment plan that includes Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor, usually looking for PD-L1 expressions to latch onto, and is often quite effective when there's higher expression.\n\nNow, the twist here is the patient's PD-L1 expression is 0%. That makes me pause because generally, we expect less response with immunotherapy if there's nothing for it to target effectively.\n\nThen there's the Tumor Mutational Burden, or TMB, which is 5.5 mutations per megabase. I know higher numbers here can mean better responses to immunotherapy, but at 5.5, this is pretty low, especially for a current smoker where I'd expect it to maybe be higher. Smoking is usually tied to more mutations, but in this case, it doesn't seem to bump the TMB up significantly.\n\nSo, combining these treatments is likely an approach to make the best out of the situation. Chemotherapy, both Pemetrexed and Carboplatin, might help by boosting the overall effect of the treatment, even though this patient's immunotherapy prospects aren't the greatest with the low PD-L1 and TMB.\n\nIf I think about what all this means, I'd guess that the treatment might hold the disease steady for a while, like keeping it stable. But I'm not seeing high chances of a dramatic remission here. The absence of high PD-L1 and a low TMB just don't spell out a strong response to Pembrolizumab. So, I would say we might see stable disease or a minor response at best.\n\nAlright, all things considered, this lines up with what I've read about such cases. It seems consistent with expectations when the biomarkers don't show much promise. So, yeah, I'd stick with the conclusion that this patient is likely to have some disease control but probably nothing too long-lasting or deeply impactful in terms of remission.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven a 61-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma, a current smoking history, no liver or brain metastasis, negative EGFR and ALK status, PD-L1 expression of 0%, and a TMB of 5.5 mutations/Mb, who is receiving a treatment regimen of Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin, what is the most likely treatment response in terms of disease progression or remission?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
