    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's break down what's going on with this patient. She's 49 and dealing with lung cancer, specifically the adenocarcinoma type. Now, from what I know, adenocarcinoma is a common type of non-small cell lung cancer, and the Pemetrexed and Cisplatin combo is a go-to treatment here.

Hmm, yeah, she's got negative ALK and ROS1, so this treatment fits. \n\nNow, let's think about that PD-L1 expression of hers, which stands at 10%. It’s not nothing, but it’s not super high either. Higher levels are better for immunotherapy responses, but since she’s on chemo right now, that’s just a little nugget of info to tuck away unless we switch courses later on. So, what’s that mean for chemo response here? Well, PD-L1 doesn't really change much for chemo, but it sure keeps the door open for immunotherapy if needed down the line. \n\nAlright, focusing back on the chemo, typically with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin, the response rates hover around 20-30%. Statistically speaking, and given her adenocarcinoma, we might expect something like a partial response or maybe stable disease. Oh, and her moderate PD-L1 expression doesn’t particularly boost that response rate with her current treatment, but it’s useful info to have. \n\nPutting it all together, we’ve got a woman on a well-matched chemo regimen for her type of lung cancer, no specific mutations to target, and some PD-L1 expression that might come in handy later. Given the standard responses we see with this chemotherapy combo, yeah, it seems like a partial response or stable disease is pretty likely.
