    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, so we're dealing with a 67-year-old male who has adenocarcinoma, and his PD-L1 expression level is quite high at 80%.

Oh, and he specifically has brain metastasis, which complicates things a bit. But, Pembrolizumab is part of his treatment plan, and it targets PD-1. That's supposed to be quite effective for high PD-L1 expression cases. I remember reading somewhere that Pembrolizumab has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.
