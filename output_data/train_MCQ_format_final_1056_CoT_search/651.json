    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so let's see what we know about ALK positive NSCLC. I know that this type of lung cancer can be pretty aggressive because the mutations in the ALK gene make the cancer cells grow continuously. But, the good part is that there are some specific treatments called ALK inhibitors that can really help. These treatments target that pesky ALK pathway that keeps driving the cancer.\n\nNow, Lorlatinib comes into the picture. It's like a next-level ALK inhibitor, more advanced than the previous ones. I recall it's particularly useful when others like crizotinib, alectinib, or ceritinib don't work anymore. Oh, and another big thing is that it does well against brain metastases because it can effectively reach the brain. That's a huge plus since brain metastases are a tough nut to crack.\n\nFrom what I've read, patients on Lorlatinib seem to respond quite well. You often see their tumors shrinking which is a great sign. Especially for those with tumors in the brain, which Lorlatinib can handle quite effectively thanks to its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. It's like having a special password to get into prohibited areas.\n\nCompared to its predecessors, Lorlatinib seems to do a better job, especially in cases where there are those tricky resistance mutations or brain involvements. Yeah, it seems to outperform earlier drugs, especially for brain-related issues.\n\nSo, putting this all together, when someone with an ALK positive status is treated with Lorlatinib, especially with brain metastasis involved, you can likely expect the tumors to shrink noticeably, both anywhere else in the body and in the brain, too. And the patient might enjoy a longer period without the cancer worsening.\n\nAnd to make sure I'm on track, this matches up with the data I've seen. Lorlatinib has shown pretty solid results in clinical trials and studies. Sounds like it's a real game-changer for people in this situation. Yeah, that's likely the way it would go, extended periods without progression and a strong response.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the patient's clinical profile with a positive ALK status, brain metastasis, and treatment with Lorlatinib, what is the most likely treatment response observed in similar cases?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
