    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so we have a 58-year-old guy dealing with a pretty tough case of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, specifically of the adenocarcinoma variety. His cancer's managed to spread to his brain, which is never good news. Let's break this down a bit.\n\nFirst up, his tumor has wild-type EGFR, which means EGFR-targeted therapies are off the table since they typically work best when mutations are present. And when we look at ALK and ROS1, both are negative too. What this tells us is that targeted therapies against these drivers won't be beneficial either, so classic chemotherapy seems like the way to go.\n\nNow, there's this crucial piece of information about PD-L1 expression being at a flat 0%. Normally, we would think about immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab if that number was higher, but in this case, it's probably not going to do much. So, not really an option here.\n\nOh, but wait—there's this interesting twist with the high tumor mutational burden at 35.4 mutations per megabase. That's pretty high, and it could mean the tumor might respond to immunotherapy regardless of the low PD-L1. But again, given the PD-L1 status, it's a bit of a gamble.\n\nAnyway, he's currently being treated with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin, which is pretty standard fare for non-squamous NSCLC. These drugs are generally expected to control the disease rather than eliminate it, especially with brain metastases in the mix. With those, systemic therapy's effectiveness can be a bit hit or miss.\n\nSo, what does this all mean for his treatment response? Given the circumstances, I'm betting on a modest response. Maybe we'll see some stabilization, maybe some reduction in tumor size, but likely not a miracle cure.\n\nOverall, the real aim here seems to be managing the cancer and symptoms, not offering a complete remission. This is all lining up with how we understand the treatment outcomes and typical chemotherapy responses in these cases.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 58-year-old male patient with a non-squamous cell lung carcinoma, adenocarcinoma histology, brain metastasis, wild-type EGFR, negative ALK and ROS1 status, PD-L1 expression of 0%, and high tumor mutational burden (35.4 mutations/Mb), receiving chemotherapy with a Pemetrexed/Cisplatin regimen, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
