    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's break this down. We're looking at an EGFR E20ins mutation here. I know that mutations in exon 20 of the EGFR gene are a bit tricky. They're not the easiest to manage because they don't respond well to the usual EGFR TKIs like Afatinib. These exon 20 insertions are known for their resistance. Oh, and Afatinib—we know it's a second-generation TKI that tries to do its best by targeting EGFR, but for this mutation? It's not the star player.\n\nNow, let's think about this high PD-L1 expression. High levels could be a silver lining because they indicate a chance for immunotherapy to work. Immune checkpoint inhibitors might be helpful here. But usually, we try to deal with the mutation-targeted treatments first before diving head-first into immunotherapy. It's like having a tool in the toolbox that we know we might get to use later on if needed.\n\nGiven these points, I'd wager that the outcome with Afatinib here won't be as rosy as we'd like. It's just not the ideal match for an EGFR E20ins. Newer treatments specifically designed for these exon 20 insertions, like amivantamab or mobocertinib, are probably more what we'd hope to try because they show more promise.\n\nIn conclusion, taking all this into account, I'd say that using Afatinib on this patient is likely to have limited results. We're not expecting substantial shrinkage or control over the disease with this TKI. This feels consistent with the evidence out there.
