    "<Internal Thinking>\nLet's think about what's going on with the patient. We've got a 51-year-old female with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. The key biomarkers here are screaming for our attention: PD-L1 expression is at 0%, which often means that Pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, might not be that effective on its own. Typically, the magic of Pembrolizumab comes alive when PD-L1 expression is higher.\n\nNow, let's see where chemotherapy fits into the picture. Paclitaxel and Carboplatin – these are like the bread and butter for treating non-small cell lung cancer, especially in a setting where PD-L1 isn't helping us out. They're pretty standard for trying to get some control over the cancer, often helping to shrink tumors regardless of PD-L1 status. And yes, the absence of any liver or brain metastases is definitely a good thing. It suggests the situation might not be as aggressive as it could be.\n\nOh, don't forget the Tumor Mutational Burden, or TMB. With a TMB of 6.4 mutations/Mb, it's somewhat on the lower side. This usually doesn't scream 'great response to immunotherapy,' because higher TMB levels typically indicate a better chance that the immune system will go into overdrive.\n\nOkay, considering all of these factors, it's like piecing a puzzle together. The combination of chemotherapy with Pembrolizumab might still have some reason to hope due to its potential synergistic effects, even if PD-L1 is 0%. But in all honesty, the major player here seems to be the chemotherapy. It's going to be responsible for most of the heavy lifting.\n\nPutting it all together, it's likely the treatment will initially offer some disease control, mostly due to Paclitaxel and Carboplatin. However, because the Pembrolizumab isn't getting a boost from PD-L1, and the low TMB doesn't tip the scales toward a strong immune response, the chances of halting the disease progression long-term aren't super high. Stable disease might be the best case scenario for now, with gradual progression being a strong possibility over time.\n\nSo, yeah, it looks like we're looking at initial disease stabilization from the chemotherapy with a likely eventual progression, due to the limitations posed by the biomarkers. All the while, we're buying some time with the combo treatment, but the lack of strong biomarker support keeps expectations realistic.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of a 51-year-old female patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, no liver or brain metastasis, PD-L1 expression of 0%, and receiving a treatment regimen of Pembrolizumab/Paclitaxel/Carboplatin with a tumor mutational burden of 6.4 mutations/Mb, what is the most likely treatment response in terms of disease progression?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
