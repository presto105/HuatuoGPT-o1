Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this. Osimertinib is this advanced drug, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that's specifically tailored to deal with those tricky EGFR mutations. It's like it zeroes in on them, particularly the T790M mutation. And here's the really cool part, it can actually work its way into the central nervous system. So, that's impressive.\n\nNow, considering this patient's situation, he's got adenocarcinoma with an EGFR mutation. That's a pretty strong case for using EGFR TKIs, like our friend osimertinib here. These patients generally respond well, as the drug goes straight for those mutations. It's like matching the right key to a lock.\n\nAnd oh, let's not forget the brain metastases. Osimertinib is pretty nifty at crossing the blood-brain barrier. That's a huge plus for our patient here. Treating brain metastases can be really challenging, but this drug seems to have an edge there.\n\nThen there's his age. Being 88 years old, we can't ignore that. But actually, osimertinib has a pretty good safety profile, which is reassuring. Older patients need something that's effective but also gentle enough. This drug seems to fit that bill.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, it looks like osimertinib is a great choice for this patient. With his EGFR mutation-positive adenocarcinoma and those brain metastases, it should work really well. And considering his age, it should be tolerable too. Seems like a win-win situation.\n\nYeah, this reasoning aligns well with what we know from clinical data. Osimertinib is known to be effective in these cases.
