    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through step by step. We have a 61-year-old male patient with an adenocarcinoma. The treatment he's on involves a combination of Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin, followed by Lenvatinib. Usually, Pembrolizumab works best when PD-L1 expression is high, but in his case, it's actually 0%. That's not great because it usually means Pembrolizumab might not be as effective. \n\nBut hold on, there's a twist. Even when PD-L1 is low or not expressed, combining Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy agents like Pemetrexed and Carboplatin has sometimes shown some benefits. Why? Well, apparently, these combinations can still boost immune response, maybe because they help to activate T-cells or something along those lines. \n\nNow, about the genetic side of things. The report says he has wild-type EGFR and is negative for ALK mutations. This is important because if there were mutations, we'd probably be looking at targeted therapies. Also, no data on Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) here. Regardless, higher TMB usually hints at better responses to immunotherapies, but since we don’t have that data, it’s a bit of a guessing game in this aspect. \n\nAnd let’s not forget Lenvatinib. It's a multi-kinase inhibitor, stepping in after the initial combo treatment. Its role could be to specifically target any cancer cells that are sticking around after the first line of treatment. \n\nWhat’s all this adding up to? I’d say there's a decent chance the treatment had some positive effects, like maybe a partial response or at least stabilizing things. Without solid TMB data or more biomarkers, pinpointing the exact outcome is tough. \n\nAll in all, I’d lean towards some response but can’t say for sure if it was a complete, partial, or just stable disease. Just a solid guess based on what we’ve got.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the clinical profile of a 61-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma histology, no liver or brain metastasis, wild-type EGFR, negative ALK status, 0% PD-L1 expression, undergoing treatment with Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin followed by Lenvatinib, and specific genetic mutations and TMB, what was the observed treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
