Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nLet's figure out what's going on here. This patient is a 71-year-old man, and he’s dealing with adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer. Now, because there are liver metastases, it means the cancer has spread, suggesting we're in a more serious stage, probably stage IV. This usually means things can be difficult and the prognosis isn’t the rosiest.\n\nNow, looking at the PD-L1 expression – it's at 0%. Hmmm, that's quite low, and it tells us that the tumor isn't showing the protein Pembrolizumab is looking to target.

The combo can lead to at least some control over the cancer, maybe leading to a partial shrinkage or even just stopping it in its tracks.\n\nNow, let’s just double-check. From what we know about these kinds of cases, even when the PD-L1 is low, this treatment combo tends to bring about some level of response.
