    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's take a closer look at this patient. She's a 77-year-old woman dealing with quite advanced cancer. She's got adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis, which often means stage IV for non-small cell lung cancer. That's pretty serious.\n\nNow, looking at her genetic makeup. Her cancer is wild-type for EGFR. Basically, that means there aren't those common mutations in the EGFR gene that some treatments target. Unfortunately, that means certain medications like tyrosine kinase inhibitors won't work here.\n\nThen we've got ALK and ROS1. She's negative for both. In short, that's a no-go for targeted therapies related to those genes. Darn, it's always nice when there's a clear target for treatment.\n\nNext, let's consider her PD-L1 status. It's at 0%, which is kind of a bummer because having PD-L1 expression can open up some immunotherapy options. Without it, those PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are not likely to be super helpful.\n\nShe's on a chemotherapy regimen with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. That's a pretty standard first-line approach for someone in her situation. They usually help with non-squamous NSCLC, especially when there aren't specific genetic markers to target.\n\nSo, based on all this, what kind of response can we expect from her treatment? Well, given the situation, it's realistic to think about a stable disease or maybe a partial response, where the cancer doesn't get a whole lot worse and might even shrink a bit. Complete remission would be fantastic, but it's less likely with what we're working with here.\n\nTo wrap it up, her situation and treatment point towards slowing down the disease and potentially reducing tumor size, which lines up with typical results for similar patients undergoing this regimen. It's all about managing expectations realistically here.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the provided clinical profile of a 77-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma, liver metastasis, wild-type EGFR status, negative ALK and ROS1 status, 0% PD-L1 expression, and undergoing chemotherapy with Pemetrexed/Cisplatin, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
