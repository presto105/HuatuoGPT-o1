    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's start by looking at PD-L1 expression here. I know PD-L1 is this protein that could pop up on tumor cells, right? And it messes with the immune system trying to attack the cancer. So, when I see PD-L1 expression at 80%, that's pretty high, isn't it? From what I remember, higher PD-L1 might mean better response to treatments like nivolumab. Those inhibitors really work well when PD-L1 levels are up there.\n\nNow, let's think about the Tumor Mutational Burden, or TMB for short. TMB kind of sounds like a measure of how many changes or mistakes are in the tumor's DNA. If there's a lot, like, say, 15 mutations per megabase, which is what we have in this case, the immune system might have more targets to go after, right? That could be a good sign for treatment with immunotherapy because the more targets the immune system has, the better it might work.\n\nThis patient is 84 and male. Age can sometimes be a factor in these treatments, but here, the PD-L1 and TMB are key. Oh, and I remember that the gender and age play a smaller role when we have strong indicators like PD-L1 and TMB.\n\nSo, how does nivolumab fit into all this? Nivolumab is one of those PD-1 inhibitors, and it's supposed to cut the cancer's ability to sneak by the immune system. If I think about it, with high PD-L1 and TMB, the tumor is already set up to react well to this kind of therapy. It's like nivolumab was made for situations just like this to help the immune system unleash its full potential.\n\nIn conclusion, with these factors in mind, I'm thinking this patient might really benefit from nivolumab. The stars seem to align when it comes to the PD-L1 levels and that high TMB. It looks like a recipe for a solid response to the treatment, aiming for tumor shrinkage and hopefully longer progression-free periods.\n\nYup, I feel pretty confident in this outcome after going through all the info. It does all seem to point toward a good reaction to the nivolumab therapy.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the patient's clinical profile, including an 84-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma, PD-L1 expression of 80%, and a tumor mutational burden of 15.0 mutations/Mb under nivolumab immunotherapy, what is the most likely treatment response expected in this scenario?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
