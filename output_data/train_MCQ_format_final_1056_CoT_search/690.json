    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think about this patient's situation. So, we're dealing with a 75-year-old man diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, and the cancer has unfortunately spread to the brain and liver. First off, the fact that we're looking at a wild-type EGFR status and negative tests for ALK and ROS1 rearrangements tells me we don't have certain targeted therapies in play, which are often based on specific genetic mutations.\n\nNow, one important clue here is the high PD-L1 expression that's greater than 50%. This high expression is like a beacon signaling that the patient's cancer might evade the immune system, and using immunotherapy drugs, especially PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, becomes a tempting option because they can effectively target this pathway.\n\nThey're currently on a chemotherapy course with pemetrexed and cisplatin, which I know is a solid choice for non-small cell lung cancer, especially at advanced stages. This regimen is well-known to tackle the systemic toll of the disease, offering a respectable control over tumor burden. Yet, the high PD-L1 expression keeps shining through my thoughts.\n\nHmm, let's compare. Chemotherapy like pemetrexed and cisplatin can surely offer benefits like reducing tumor size and alleviating symptoms, though, the response can be quite variable. On the flip side, high PD-L1 expression hints quite strongly that if we threw in something like pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, the patient's body might rally a much stronger immune response against the cancer - this is because these drugs unleash T-cells to attack PD-L1 overexpressing tumors.\n\nSo, with just the chemo, some tumor shrinkage or stabilization is likely, which is good, but I'm concerned it might not maximize the potential benefit given the circumstances. If we added an immunotherapy, the response could be more significant; complete or partial remission becomes more achievable.\n\nTo sum it up, given what I'm seeing here - a high PD-L1 combined with a standard chemotherapy regimen of pemetrexed and cisplatin - the patient might experience some level of benefit, but they might just be tapping into much more substantial improvements if we introduce immunotherapy into the mix. This aligns with clinical tendencies for cases with these characteristics.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the detailed clinical profile of a 75-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma, brain and liver metastasis, wild-type EGFR status, ALK and ROS1 negative, high PD-L1 expression (>50%), and undergoing a pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy regimen, what is the most likely treatment response observed?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>. The response style should resemble GPT-4's style as much as possible. Output only your final response, without any additional content."

    "Given the patient's clinical profile, the current chemotherapy regimen of pemetrexed and cisplatin is likely to provide some level of tumor control, such as reduction in tumor size or stabilization of disease progression.
