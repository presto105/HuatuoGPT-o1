Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "To determine the most likely treatment response for the patient, we need to integrate several critical factors. If the patient is younger, they may respond more robustly to treatment due to better physiological resilience. The type of cancer and its histological characteristics are crucial; certain types are inherently more aggressive or have different treatment pathways. \n\nGenetic mutations, such as the presence of an EGFR mutation in lung cancer, can significantly impact treatment approaches. Patients with specific mutations may respond well to targeted therapies like EGFR inhibitors unless resistance to the treatment has developed or there is significant metastasis. Metastasis generally indicates a more advanced stage of cancer and often requires a systemic treatment approach. However, the molecular profile can still guide therapies effectively.\n\nThe current treatment regimen should align with what the genetic and biomarker data suggest. For instance, high PD-L1 expression in some cancers may make the patient a candidate for immunotherapy, potentially leading to a favorable response if there are no complicating factors. \n\nIn conclusion, a patient with an EGFR mutation in lung cancer on an appropriate EGFR inhibitor could expect a positive response if there is no drug resistance or extensive disease progression due to metastasis. Cross-referencing with clinical trial data and recent evidence will solidify this expectation. If all the factors, including patient-specific biomarkers and treatment alignment, are consistent, a positive response is likely. Conversely, if there are discrepancies, further investigation may be needed to adjust the treatment strategy."
