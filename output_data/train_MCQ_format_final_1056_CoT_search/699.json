    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's dive into this. So, we have a 69-year-old woman with this type of lung cancer called non-squamous cell carcinoma, and the specific kind is adenocarcinoma. Here’s a big deal - she has brain metastases, meaning the cancer has spread to her brain. Also, she's never smoked, which is interesting because it often impacts treatment paths and options a bit. \n\nNow, here comes the crucial part: she has this EGFR mutation, specifically the exon 19 deletion or E19del. This is actually kind of critical, as it opens up a specific treatment route using a drug called Afatinib. This is what she's on, and it's a targeted therapy essentially designed to do battle against that EGFR mutation. \n\nTalking about Afatinib, it’s known for being quite effective with this particular E19del mutation. From what I gather, patients with this mutation tend to respond quite well, especially when it comes to the primary tumor sites in the lungs. It targets and binds irreversibly, aiming to really stunt the cancer's ability to grow. What about the brain metastases? Well, that's a bit of a mixed bag because while Afatinib tries to cross into the brain area via the blood-brain barrier, its success rate isn't uniform across all patients.\n\nLet's not forget about her being underweight, with a BMI of 16.89. It might not affect how Afatinib works per se in terms of its chemistry on EGFR, but low BMI could indicate a few other health challenges or issues with handling the treatment’s side effects. A person's overall health and weight could impact how they deal with the treatment in general.\n\nNow, reflecting on clinical studies. Generally, they indicate strong outcomes for someone with her genetic profile on Afatinib, particularly in lung tumors. However, with brain metastases, the benefits can be a bit less dramatic due to that pesky brain barrier and how well the drug gets through.\n\nSo, what’s the likely scenario here? Considering her mutation and treatment, we would anticipate a significant response with tumor size reduction in her lung areas, hopefully a partial response. As for the brain metastases, it's reasonable to think about stabilization rather than dramatic shrinkage, given what we know about the drug's limitations in CNS areas.\n\nAlright, all these bits put together make a nice puzzle. Afatinib likely offers her a good shot at shrinking the primary lung tumors significantly and could stabilize the brain metastases. It’s always important to think about individual variances, though, since bodies can react uniquely.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven the clinical profile of a 69-year-old female patient with non-squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma histology, and brain metastasis, who is non-smoker, with BMI of 16.89 and EGFR E19del mutation, and is being treated with the targeted therapy Afatinib, what is the most likely treatment response observed?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
