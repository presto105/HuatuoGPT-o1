    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about this. We have a 66-year-old woman with adenocarcinoma, and there's something interesting going on here — she has the EGFR L858R mutation. Now, why does that matter? Well, it's because this mutation tends to make the cancer pretty sensitive to certain treatments, specifically those targeting the EGFR protein.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Gefitinib, the drug she's on, is actually tailored to this situation. It's like a lock-and-key mechanism where gefitinib inhibits the activity of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, which has gone a bit haywire due to this mutation. This overactive kinase is a big player in helping the cancer grow and survive. So, gefitinib steps in to clamp down on this cancer-friendly environment.\n\nWhat does all this mean for our patient? Typically, when you have this L858R mutation and you're on gefitinib, you see things like the tumor getting smaller or at least not growing as wildly. It's kind of similar to calming a raging storm — things start to look more manageable.\n\nIt's crucial to keep in mind that response can vary. Factors like the patient’s health, if other mutations are in the mix, or even how faithfully she’s taking the medication can influence outcomes. Yet, that mutation is a pretty strong indication that she'll have a good shot at responding well to this treatment.\n\nSo, zooming out and putting it all together, this 66-year-old lady with the EGFR L858R mutation being treated with gefitinib is likely going to experience stabilization of her disease. And by stabilization, I mean that her condition probably won't get worse for a while, which is fantastic news given the circumstances.\n\nCross-checking all this with what we generally see, yeah, it fits. Patients with this specific mutation treated in this way often do see their disease stabilize or even improve, making this a likely scenario for her.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of the 66-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma, EGFR L858R mutation, and undergoing gefitinib targeted therapy, what is the most likely treatment response in terms of disease stability?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
