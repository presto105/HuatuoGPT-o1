The chemo should work to some extent, especially combined with potential immunotherapy due to the PD-L1 expression. But I'm thinking the copy number gains could dull down the chemo's effect just a bit.\n\nAnyway, after considering what usually happens with patients like her and peeking into some recent treatment outcomes, a partial response or stable disease seems like a reasonable expectation.
