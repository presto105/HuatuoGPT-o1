    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through. We have a 72-year-old male dealing with adenocarcinoma, and it's not the squamous cell type. That matters because treatments can vary depending on the type. Now, I see his tumor doesn't express any PD-L1 protein, which makes me wonder about how effective pembrolizumab, an immune therapy, might be. Usually, pembrolizumab works better when there's more PD-L1 expression to target.\n\nOh, and there's a KRAS mutation in play. That's a pretty big deal because KRAS mutations often lead to a tougher battle. They tend to mean the cancer doesn't respond well to some of the newer, targeted therapies out there. So, we're looking at a pretty stubborn type of cancer.\n\nThe treatment plan includes a combination of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin. Even though the pembrolizumab might not pack a punch due to the tumor's 0% PD-L1 expression, the chemotherapy duo, pemetrexed and carboplatin, is kind of the backbone here. They're common for tackling non-small cell lung cancer and can be quite effective on their own.\n\nI guess when we think about outcomes, we're trying to predict how this combination will play out. Considering the low PD-L1 and the presence of a KRAS mutation, I wouldn't expect pembrolizumab to be the star of the show. But the chemotherapy could potentially shrink the tumor or at least keep it from growing too quickly, at least for a while.\n\nSo what's likely? Maybe a partial response is what we'll see at first, thanks to the chemo. But without much help from the pembrolizumab, I think progression of the disease could happen down the line. The initial response might offer some hope and stability, but there's a tricky road ahead because of the KRAS mutation making things more unpredictable and challenging.\n\nIn wrapping this up, it seems like there's a good chance for some initial success with the chemo, but the long-term outlook might not be as rosy. Eventually, the disease could start progressing, and we might need to rethink or adjust treatment strategies. That's kind of my gut feeling based on all these factors coming together.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the provided patient clinical profile, which includes a 72-year-old male with adenocarcinoma non-SqCC, PD-L1 expression of 0%, and a KRAS mutation undergoing a combination treatment of Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin, what is the most likely outcome in terms of disease progression?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
