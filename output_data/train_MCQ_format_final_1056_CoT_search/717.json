Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",

    "<Internal Thinking>\nSo, we've got a 65-year-old woman dealing with adenocarcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer. She's tested negative for those common mutations—EGFR, ALK, and ROS1, which means no targeted pill-like treatments for her, because they won't work here. Bummer, that's quite a limitation.\n\nLet's take a look at her PD-L1 status. It's low, which isn't ideal for using those checkpoint inhibitors like PD-1 or PD-L1 drugs. The higher the PD-L1, usually the better the immune therapy works, but she's on the lower side. That's gonna affect how well any immunotherapy might help her.\n\nShe's currently on a chemo cocktail of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin. That's pretty textbook for someone in her position. Chemotherapy can work, but it's a bit like a wildcard, with each person's cancer reacting differently. We often see some shrinkage of the tumor, but it can vary.\n\nNow, I’m thinking, since her PD-L1 expression is low, the chance for a significant impact from immunotherapy drops, right? It's logical. The chemo might stabilize her illness or cut it back a little, but not usually enough to cause a big celebration.\n\nAll in all, it's not the dream scenario with no targeted mutation therapy or high PD-L1 expression to work with others. Realistically, we're probably looking at stable disease or perhaps a partial response—something along those lines where the cancer isn't growing out of control but not disappearing either.
