    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so we're looking at a patient with adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma means we're dealing with cancer that starts in mucus-secreting glands. Oh, good news! There's no metastasis here, which usually means the cancer hasn't spread out widely, right? This makes me think the treatment could be more effective since it’s localized.\n\nNow, for the treatment part, he’s on Gemcitabine and Carboplatin. I know that Gemcitabine is pretty interesting because it's a nucleoside analogue—it messes up DNA synthesis. And Carboplatin? Well, it binds to the DNA and leads to cell death. This combo seems to be quite the duo for treating lung adenocarcinoma and other similar solid tumors.\n\nOh, here’s something that caught my eye—PD-L1 expression is at 90%. That’s really high! PD-L1 is this protein that cancer cells use to kind of hide from the immune system. Usually, a high PD-L1 means the cancer could respond well to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, those cool immunotherapies.\n\nBut wait a second, those inhibitors aren't part of this treatment plan. So, this high PD-L1 level isn't directly being targeted here. Hmm, that's a bit of a bummer since those are super effective; however, chemotherapy could still be a viable strategy, especially given there’s no metastasis here.\n\nWith this treatment regimen—Gemcitabine and Carboplatin—what can we expect? Despite the high PD-L1 expression, which would have been great for immunotherapy, this combo can still work. Typically, you might see something like stable disease or even a partial response.\n\nIn the end, since the cancer hasn't spread and considering the treatment agents, I think the most likely response would be either stable disease or partial response. I’ve thought about this from several angles, and even though it might be tempting to think about the potential of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors due to the high PD-L1 levels, the current setup still points toward a decent outcome with chemotherapy.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the clinical profile of an 86-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma, no metastasis, and a PD-L1 (22C3) expression of 90% undergoing Gemcitabine/Carboplatin treatment, what is the most likely treatment response observed?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
