    "<Internal Thinking>\nSo, let's see, adenocarcinoma is a type of non-small cell lung cancer, right? And when we talk about EGFR mutations like the L858R mutation, it usually means that the cancer cells tend to be more vulnerable to certain treatments. Specifically, these mutations can make them more susceptible to drugs that target EGFR, like Gefitinib.\n\nNow, Gefitinib... that's an interesting one. It's a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that works by shutting down the activity of the EGFR, which has a pretty big role in the growth of these cancer cells. By inhibiting this pathway, Gefitinib can slow down or sometimes even shrink the tumors. Patients with the L858R mutation often see a good response from this drug. So far, so good.\n\nBut what about this patient? She's 78 and has brain metastasis. That's a tricky situation because not all treatments effectively cross the blood-brain barrier. Fortunately, Gefitinib is one of those drugs that's shown to have some effect on brain metastases. So, we've got that working in her favor too.\n\nThinking about her overall profile, she's got a mutation known to respond well to Gefitinib, even with brain involvement. And while her age might suggest some general health considerations, when it comes to her cancer treatment specifically, it doesn't seem to hinder Gefitinib's action on her cancer cells.\n\nSo, putting all of this together, it seems quite likely that she'd experience a positive effect from the Gefitinib. We're talking tumor shrinkage or stabilization here. It's what many studies have shown for patients like her with the L858R mutation, even with brain metastasis. So I’d expect she’ll likely see some beneficial response.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nGiven a 78-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma at the non-squamous cell cancer stage, brain metastasis, an EGFR L858R mutation, and treated with Gefitinib, what is the most likely treatment response for this patient's profile?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
