    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's break this down. The patient has non-small cell lung cancer, but not the squamous type—it’s actually adenocarcinoma. That means we’re not looking at squamous cell treatments, and we have to consider options best tailored to adenocarcinoma.\n\nWhen it comes to targeted therapies, we're out of luck. The typical markers like EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 are negative, which means those specific targeted treatments aren’t going to work here. And then there's PD-L1 expression, which is at 0%. Sadly, this really limits our options with immunotherapy because these treatments usually work better when PD-L1 levels are higher.\n\nGiven all this, we have to think about standard chemotherapy options. Hmm, for non-squamous types like this one, there's a regimen known to work pretty well—pemetrexed combined with cisplatin. This combo is often used for cases exactly like this.\n\nBut what about the brain metastases? That’s usually a tricky spot. Still, systemic chemotherapy, the kind that treats cancer throughout the body, can sometimes help with brain metastases too. It’s not as targeted as radiation, but it can still slow things down or prevent them from getting worse.\n\nThe effectiveness of this chemotherapy combo isn’t guaranteed, though. We have no driver mutations or significant PD-L1 expression to rely on, so we’re banking on a standard response. When you look at statistics, chemotherapy in these scenarios tends to give moderate control. It might stabilize the disease or even shrink the tumors a bit, but the responses can vary greatly from one patient to another.\n\nSo, what’s the likeliest scenario here? With this regimen, we're probably looking at partial response or at least stable disease. It won’t be a miraculous reversal, but hopefully, it will keep things in check. This matches up pretty well with what oncologists usually see in practice.\n\nIn conclusion, we’re going with pemetrexed and cisplatin. Given all we know about the cancer and available options, hoping for moderate success with this treatment seems about right. Doctors would most likely anticipate such an outcome in similar cases, so it’s an educated, evidence-based guess.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the patient's clinical profile, including a non-squamous cell lung cancer status with adenocarcinoma histology, no liver metastasis, and presence of brain metastasis, along with negative EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 status and PD-L1 expression at 0%, what is the most likely treatment response to Pemetrexed/Cisplatin chemotherapy?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
