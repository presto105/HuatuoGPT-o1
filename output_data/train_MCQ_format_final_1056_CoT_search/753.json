    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's see. The patient's dealing with adenocarcinoma that's spread to the brain, which puts them at an advanced stage of lung cancer. It's serious business. Now, the PD-L1 expression is sitting at just 2%. That's quite low, and that usually means treatments targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 aren't going to be super effective if used alone. So, not the best news there.\n\nWhen I look at the genetic profile, the EGFR is wild-type. That means we can’t use those fancy EGFR-targeted treatments. They just won’t work here.

They started on Pemetrexed combined with Cisplatin. This is pretty standard stuff for non-small-cell lung cancer, especially for adenocarcinoma types. And it seems like after a few rounds of this combo, they've moved onto Pemetrexed on its own. This step makes sense if the patient was managing okay and the cancer wasn’t causing too much trouble after initial treatment.\n\nHmm, thinking about how the patient might respond… With Cisplatin in their system, especially if they were in good health otherwise, you'd expect a decent shot at some tumor shrinkage or at least things not getting worse. Keeping Pemetrexed going as maintenance tells me that things might have calmed down a bit with the Cisplatin.\n\nAnd what about immunotherapy? Well, that low PD-L1 expression we talked about earlier doesn’t scream magic solution here. So, we're really leaning on what the chemo has done.\n\nLet's piece all this together. The switch to Pemetrexed alone hints at stable disease status or maybe even a partial response. That's typically how the story goes when this kind of regimen manages to hold down the fort.\n\nDouble-checking, this approach aligns with the playbook for Stage IV lung cancer that's adenocarcinoma.
