    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's break this down. The patient in question is a 79-year-old woman diagnosed with lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma. The key thing here is she has an EGFR L858R mutation. Now, this type of mutation is pretty common in non-small cell lung cancer, and importantly, it's known to respond well to certain drugs, particularly EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs for short.\n\nFirstly, she's being treated with Afatinib. Why Afatinib? Well, it's quite effective for the L858R mutation and often used as a first-line treatment because it can really pack a punch in targeting these specific cancer cells. But here's the thing, cancer is tricky – sometimes the body becomes resistant to these drugs.\n\nThat's probably why the use of a second drug, Gefitinib, comes into play. So, why switch? If there's resistance or any issues with tolerating Afatinib, switching to another TKI like Gefitinib can help. Think of it like Tag-Team Wrestling; if one drug's effectiveness wanes or starts causing too much trouble, bring in its partner to continue the fight.\n\nSo, what about the results here, the treatment response? With these targeted therapies, especially tailored for the patient's specific genetic mutation, the expectation is a positive initial response. Afatinib initially should stabilize or maybe even shrink the tumor. Switching to Gefitinib can, hopefully, sustain this response despite any drug resistance that crops up.\n\nThe absence of brain metastasis is another good sign here. If there were brain metastases, treatment would likely be more complicated. But since there aren't any, the focus can stay on controlling the primary and secondary sites, like the liver in this case.\n\nAll things considered, given the targeted nature of the drugs against the specific mutation the patient has, it's reasonable to predict a favorable response, at least at the outset. It's like the drugs are tailor-made to hit the cancer where it hurts.\n\nIn sum, the combination of Afatinib and Gefitinib, in this context, seems like a strategic and hopeful approach aiming to outsmart the cancer's potential resistance.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nConsidering the clinical profile of a 79-year-old female patient with adenocarcinoma showing liver metastasis, no brain metastasis, and the EGFR L858R mutation, who is undergoing targeted therapy with the regimen of Afatinib followed by Gefitinib, what is the most likely treatment response based on her profile?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>.
