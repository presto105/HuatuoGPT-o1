    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's see. Pembrolizumab is a type of immunotherapy and it really targets the PD-1 pathway, working best when there's high PD-L1 expression. But this patient has 0% PD-L1, which means Pembrolizumab might not do much on its own. Hmmm, when it's combined with chemotherapy, like Pemetrexed and Carboplatin, the game changes a little. These chemo agents are pretty standard for treating non-small cell lung cancer and they can work well even if Pembrolizumab isn't doing much because of the low PD-L1 expression.\n\nThen there's the smoking aspect. The patient is a current smoker, and some people say that smoking increases mutation burden in cancers, possibly making the cancer more responsive to immunotherapies. But, with 0% PD-L1, I think any effect Pembrolizumab might have because of the smoking-related mutational burden would be minimal. The main action here seems like it's going to come from the chemotherapy.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the absence of metastasis in the liver or brain for this patient. That’s a good sign, suggesting the disease might not be too aggressive or is at least more localized, which means systemic treatments like the chemo could have a more solid impact.\n\nWith all this in mind, what’s the likely response? Hmm, I initially thought partial response might be possible due to chemo and any slight boost from Pembrolizumab and smoking status, but 0% PD-L1 keeps nagging me. Wait, it’s important that despite Pembrolizumab's limited effect, the chemotherapy combo is still strong on its own.\n\nOh, let’s not forget to think about how these treatments are doing in current studies. It looks like recent evidence really supports the idea of keeping expectations grounded with the PD-L1 status. After looking at all this, stable disease seems like the most realistic outcome here. The chemo should control the disease, but without much help from Pembrolizumab, I wouldn’t bet on a major shrinkage in tumors.\n\nYeah, stable disease fits with what we can anticipate. It’s not all clear-cut, but that conclusion aligns with a realistic expectation given what we know about these treatments and the specific profile of the patient.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nConsidering the given clinical profile of a 69-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma, which includes being a current smoker, having no liver or brain metastasis, and being treated with Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin despite a PD-L1 expression of 0%, what is the most likely treatment response?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.

    "Given the clinical profile of a 69-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma who is a current smoker and shows a PD-L1 expression of 0%, the likely treatment response to Pembrolizumab combined with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin is stable disease. Although the patient's PD-L1 negative status suggests limited efficacy from Pembrolizumab, the chemotherapy agents Pemetrexed and Carboplatin are powerful treatments on their own. These drugs are commonly used to manage non-small cell lung cancer and can exert significant control over the disease. While smoking might contribute to a higher mutation burden and potential immunotherapy benefit, the impact is expected to be minimal due to the 0% PD-L1 expression. Therefore, a stabilization of the disease is a realistic outcome, reflecting control rather than tumor regression."
