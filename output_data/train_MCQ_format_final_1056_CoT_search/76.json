    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think about this. So, PD-L1 is this protein that's like a shield, stopping immune cells from mistakenly attacking normal cells.

Either way, there's a chance for some good to come from this treatment choice.\n\nChecking this over, it lines up with what we know. High PD-L1 equals better fits for checkpoint inhibitors, but still, the chemo he's on isn't useless.
