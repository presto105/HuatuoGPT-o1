    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, so let's think about this step by step. We have a 65-year-old woman with adenocarcinoma, and she's dealing with brain metastases. That's quite a serious situation. Hmm, but here's a key detail: she has this specific EGFR mutation, the exon 19 deletion. That's really important because I know that certain mutations can actually make cancer more susceptible to targeted treatments.\n\nOh, I remember that afatinib is one of those drugs that works well with EGFR mutations. It's a second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. They say it's pretty potent against these types of mutations, especially the exon 19 deletion which our patient has. So, logically, she should respond well to afatinib, right?\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that afatinib has some ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. That's good news because it means the drug might also help with those brain metastases, which can be tricky to treat due to that barrier. So, with her condition and the mutation she has, I'd expect the treatment to at least stabilize the disease, if not shrink the tumors.\n\nBut wait, let's temper that optimism with a bit of realism. While this mutation is a good sign for treatment outcomes, the actual response can vary from person to person. Some other factors like the extent of the brain metastasis and the patient's overall health might come into play.\n\nIn conclusion, thinking about all of this, I’d say she's likely to have a positive response to afatinib. It's pretty much expected with the EGFR E19del mutation. Oh, and I remember reading multiple studies that back up this effectiveness, so that's reassuring.
