Your job is to evaluate a given question and determine whether it meets the following criteria: \n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question should require deeper reasoning. If the question appears too simple, mark it as \"Too Simple\".\n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question must have a unique and unambiguous correct answer. If the question asks for \"incorrect options\" or allows for multiple correct answers, mark it as \"Ambiguous Answer\".\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question should be suitable for reformatting into an open-ended format. If the question cannot be easily reformulated into an open-ended problem and a clear ground-truth answer, mark it as \"Not Reformulatable\".\n\nFor each question, provide one of the following evaluations:  \n- \"Pass\" (The question meets all the criteria.)  \n- \"Too Simple\"  \n- \"Ambiguous Answer\"  \n- \"Not Reformulatable\" ",
  "gpt_filter_response": "The evaluation for the given question is: \"Pass\".\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. **Depth of Reasoning:** The question requires deeper reasoning because it involves understanding complex patient data and treatment response predictions within the context of cancer biology and pharmacotherapy, particularly targeted therapy using Afatinib. This demands an understanding of the interaction between the patient's cancer profile, genetic alterations, and how they influence treatment response.\n   \n2. **Unambiguous Correct Answer:** The question has a unique and unambiguous correct answer, which is \"Partial Response,\" as indicated in the description. It does not rely on subjective judgment or partial credit options.\n\n3. **Open-Ended Reformulation Feasibility:** The question can be reasonably reformulated into an open-ended problem by asking, \"Based on the provided clinical profile and treatment details, what is the most likely treatment response for this patient?\" This formulation allows for a clear ground-truth answer, making it suitable for open-ended format conversion.",

However, this mutation is more commonly associated with adenocarcinoma rather than squamous cell carcinoma, where EGFR mutations are less frequent and their role is less clear. Therefore, we need to refine this analysis considering the cancer type."
