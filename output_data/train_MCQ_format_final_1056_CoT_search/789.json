    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's take a step-by-step look at this. We have a 64-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma and, unfortunately, it's spread to his liver.

I've seen these drugs used quite a bit, especially for squamous cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. It seems like his doctors are following a standard treatment protocol, which is reassuring.\n\nHmm, and there's this PD-L1 expression level – it’s sitting at 10%.

That seems like a reasonable outcome with this treatment approach.\n\nSo, juggling everything – the chemo regimen, the PD-L1 expression, and factoring in the liver metastasis – I'd say he's most likely to hit that partial response sweet spot or maybe stable disease. Therapies nowadays are good, but we have to be grounded in what they can realistically achieve.\n\nAnd this aligns with what I’d expect from the kind of treatment and cancer profile we're working with here.
