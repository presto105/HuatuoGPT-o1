    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through. So, we have a patient with ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer, which is a pretty significant factor. ROS1-positive patients, yeah, they usually respond really well to targeted therapies, like those ROS1 inhibitors such as crizotinib. These inhibitors are kind of the go-to because they're designed specifically for cases like this.\n\nNow, about this PD-L1 thing, it's another biomarker but it doesn't play a big role here for chemotherapy. It's mainly about immunotherapy responses, right? High PD-L1 levels might tell us about how well a patient could respond to certain immunotherapies, but for chemotherapy treatments like Pemetrexed/Cisplatin, it doesn't really change much.\n\nSpeaking of Pemetrexed/Cisplatin chemotherapy, it's commonly used for non-squamous NSCLC. It's effective, sure, but here's the rub: for ROS1-positive patients, chemotherapy may not pack as big a punch as those targeted therapies.\n\nSo, what does this all mean for our patient? Given the ROS1-positive status, the targeted therapies should ideally take the front seat. But wait, what if they're not readily available or there's some delay? In those scenarios, Pemetrexed/Cisplatin can still be part of the treatment plan.\n\nPD-L1 expression, as we mentioned, won't impact chemotherapy effectiveness directly.
