    "<Internal Thinking>\nOkay, let's think this through. We have a 78-year-old woman, and she has non-squamous cell lung cancer, which is actually pretty common in people her age.\n\nSo, her cancer is adenocarcinoma and she has a positive ALK status. That's interesting because ALK is a gene that, when mutated or fused with other genes, can drive cancer growth.

This drug is made to block that ALK fusion protein, the thing that's fueling the cancer cells.

But since she's on Alectinib, the PD-L1 thing probably isn't the key player at this moment.\n\nI've read that ALK-positive patients can respond really well to Alectinib. They often see a reduction in their tumors and their disease stabilizing. And this holds true whether they're new to this treatment or have tried other treatments before.\n\nIn this case, with her specific genetic makeup and the therapy she's getting, it's pretty likely that she's experiencing a positive response. Like, maybe her tumor sizes are getting smaller or the disease isn't progressing further, which is great.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely outcome is that she's seeing a positive treatment response with the Alectinib she’s on.
