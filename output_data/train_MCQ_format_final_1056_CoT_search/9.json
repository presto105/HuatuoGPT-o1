    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through step by step. We have a patient who's being treated for non-small cell lung cancer, specifically with a combination of Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin. So, Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor, right? It's targeting PD-1, which helps the immune system attack cancer cells. And then Pemetrexed and Carboplatin are both chemotherapy drugs. Pemetrexed disrupts cancer cell growth, and Carboplatin damages DNA in cancer cells to prevent them from replicating. This combo is quite standard for non-squamous histology NSCLC, especially when there are no actionable mutations like EGFR or ALK. That's important because if those mutations were present, the treatment plan would probably include targeted therapies instead.\n\nConsidering the patient’s age and smoking history adds another layer here. Older patients or those with a heavy smoking history might have different treatment outcomes due to their overall health status and existing conditions. Smoking, in particular, often relates to the smoking-induced cellular changes in the lungs, which could impact how the cancer responds to treatment. \n\nNow, those genetic mutations, or rather the lack of them, seem to point towards a 'wild-type' NSCLC. This is common when the treatment involves Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. If we're thinking about genetic mutations, the absence of specific ones implies the physicians expect immunotherapy to work. Oh, and Pembrolizumab is more effective when the tumor expresses PD-L1 at higher levels, enhancing the immune attack on cancer.\n\nLet's talk about what we can expect from this treatment. Patients who lack driver mutations and express PD-L1 have shown better responses to Pembrolizumab. And when combined with chemotherapy like Pemetrexed and Carboplatin, which directly attacks the cancer cells, there’s a reinforced chance of getting that tumor to shrink. \n\nHmm, taking all this into account, I'd say the most likely response for the patient is a partial response. This is backed by clinical data showing this regimen often leads to significant tumor shrinkage even if it doesn't completely wipe out the cancer. I have to keep in mind that achieving stable disease or a full response right off the bat is less common. This conclusion seems validated by how similar cases typically progress, so it's a reasonable expectation for this patient as well.\n</Internal Thinking>\n\n<Question>\nBased on the patient's clinical profile, including their age, smoking history, cancer stage, histology, genetic mutations, and treatment regimen of Pembrolizumab/Pemetrexed/Carboplatin, what is the most likely treatment response for this patient?\n</Question>\n\nThe <Internal Thinking> represents your internal thoughts about the <Question>. Based on this, generate a rich and high-quality final response to the user. If there is a clear answer, provide it first. Ensure your final response closely follows the <Question>.
