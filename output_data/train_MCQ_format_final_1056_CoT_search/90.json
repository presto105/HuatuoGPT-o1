    "<Internal Thinking>\nAlright, let's think this through step by step. Pembrolizumab is pretty well-known for its work in tackling non-small cell lung cancer, especially when PD-L1 levels are high. But a PD-L1 expression of just 1%? That's not really high at all, more like on the low side. So, generally, people respond better to this drug when PD-L1 is way above 1%, like over 50%.\n\nBut wait, there’s also KRAS to think about. This mutation often shows up in lung adenocarcinomas, and while it doesn’t necessarily exclude using Pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, it's not the star player in predicting treatment response. It’s one of those elements that's good to know about but doesn’t tell the whole story by itself.\n\nOh, let's not forget about the Tumor Mutational Burden, or TMB for short. This patient has a TMB of 10.2 mutations per megabase, which is kind of on the upper side of the scale. More mutations can sometimes mean a better response to treatments like immunotherapy, because there's more for the immune system to recognize and attack.\n\nPutting this all together, what does it mean for our patient's treatment with Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin? Well, the moderately high TMB is a plus, suggesting the patient could have a decent response to immunotherapy even though the PD-L1 level is low. The chemotherapy drugs, Pemetrexed, and Carboplatin, should help too. They’re part of the broader toolkit here, potentially boosting the overall response.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, even with only 1% PD-L1, this guy’s got a TMB that could give him a fighting chance to respond moderately well to this treatment combo. It’s kind of like, 'not super promising at first glance with the low PD-L1,' but digging deeper with TMB adds some hope. I guess it makes sense when you think about similar clinical cases; higher TMB and combination with chemotherapy can make a difference.
